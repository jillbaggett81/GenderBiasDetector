REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED for the REDACTED &amp; REDACTED\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED REDACTED for REDACTED in REDACTED REDACTED. she is remarkably dedicated to\\\\r\\\\nfostering an inclusive classroom and i have never encountered a professor more willing to\\\\r\\\\nadvocate for the health and safety of her students.\\\\r\\\\ni first took a class with professor REDACTED during my sophomore year, a year which was not my\\\\r\\\\nbest in terms of mental health and school-life balance. in fact, it was the worst year of my college\\\\r\\\\ncareer, and yet i managed to find respite in professor REDACTED\\\\u2019s REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED class.\\\\r\\\\nthere were only seven of us, so after the first week of class, we decided to meet in her office\\\\r\\\\ninstead of the classroom we were assigned. i felt closer to my classmates in that classroom than\\\\r\\\\nin any other i had experienced or have experienced since. we sat on her couch and floor, we\\\\r\\\\nshared snacks, and in the end, we produced some of the most incisive analyses i have ever\\\\r\\\\nencountered in my career as an english student. professor REDACTED always knew how to draw out\\\\r\\\\nthe nuances of our arguments, simultaneously pushing us to develop our critical thinking skills\\\\r\\\\nand making us feel valued as voices in the classroom.\\\\r\\\\nnow that i am a senior, i have worked with professor REDACTED in myriad capacities. i took her\\\\r\\\\nintro to REDACTED REDACTED class, worked as her research assistant, and she is currently\\\\r\\\\nsupervising my honors thesis. in all of these roles - teacher, supervisor, mentor - she has\\\\r\\\\nmaintained the ability to draw out and hone my strengths, allowing me to develop self-awareness\\\\r\\\\nof my weaknesses but never self-deprecation. she also consistently shows concern for my health\\\\r\\\\noutside of class; she made a point to compensate me fairly for my work as her assistant, and\\\\r\\\\nencouraged me to maintain a healthy life balance even as i was her employee. throughout\\\\r\\\\nwriting my thesis, she has consoled me, sympathized with me, and reminded me to take it easy\\\\r\\\\non myself as i complete the project in the midst of a global emergency.\\\\r\\\\nnot only do i work with professor REDACTED and enjoy her company, but i also constantly\\\\r\\\\nencounter mentions of her in my daily life. during training for an on-campus job, for instance, a\\\\r\\\\ngroup of REDACTEDs (including myself) shared our most fulfilling educational experiences. it\\\\r\\\\nwas no surprise to me when someone mentioned professor REDACTED\\\\u2019s class. the student described\\\\r\\\\nhow professor REDACTED began her lesson on queer theory by admitting her own lack of authority\\\\r\\\\non the matter. professor REDACTED explained how, as a straight woman, she wanted to privilege\\\\r\\\\nqueer student voices in the classroom over her own, as they had lived experiences and\\\\r\\\\nobservations which she did not. professor REDACTED has expressed similar sentiments in my classes\\\\r\\\\nwith her, and as a queer student myself, i cannot overemphasize the impact such explicit care and\\\\r\\\\nsupport has on students, particularly those who are still coming to terms with their sexuality and\\\\r\\\\ndo not think of their lived experiences as academically valuable.\\\\r\\\\non a similar note, i encountered her name just the other day on REDACTED. the post recommended\\\\r\\\\nseveral classes at REDACTED which deal with questions of social justice and whose curricula include\\\\r\\\\nwork by academics of all races and genders. professor REDACTED\\\\u2019s courses were featured\\\\r\\\\nprominently on that list. clearly, she has a reputation for engaging with difficult conversations\\\\r\\\\naround race, gender, sexuality, and politics carefully and incisively, and as such she has gained\\\\r\\\\ndeep respect from the REDACTED population.\\\\r\\\\nperhaps most impressively, professor REDACTED does not only encourage her students to connect\\\\r\\\\nwith and seek advice from her, but drives us to make these connections with each other. in her\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED REDACTED class, she incorporated a class-wide, communal participation grading\\\\r\\\\nsystem. all of us would receive the same participation grade at the end of the semester. for me,\\\\r\\\\nsomeone who participates often (and occasionally too much), this was daunting - i worried that\\\\r\\\\nthose who did not participate would pull my own grade down. professor REDACTED explained,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, that this system was put in place to challenge that type of individualistic thinking in the\\\\r\\\\nfirst place. she hoped that the group grade would push us to draw from each other\\\\u2019s ideas,\\\\r\\\\nencourage each other to speak up, and ultimately create a supportive community within the\\\\r\\\\nclassroom.\\\\r\\\\nof course, she was right, and she developed this policy during the pandemic deliberately.\\\\r\\\\nthrough a simple change in classroom policy, professor REDACTED motivated us to think about how\\\\r\\\\nour actions impact those around us and helped us develop the skills to be community-minded in\\\\r\\\\nour approach to both academia and our daily actions. it is this attention to how classrooms can\\\\r\\\\nserve as microcosms of the outside world alongside an unwavering dedication to bring out the\\\\r\\\\nbest in her students that makes professor REDACTED an outstanding teacher. i consider myself\\\\r\\\\nincredibly lucky to have her in my life.\\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 12',\n",

REDACTED is one of the most outstanding graduate students i have known in more than 18 years of teaching. she passed REDACTED comprehensive exams with flying colors in march 2018, conducted extensive research in bolivia and brazil thanks to a fulbright-hays grant and recently had an article accepted by diplomatic history.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED\\\\u2019s ambitious multi-sited project centers on the bolivian-brazilian plan to create a transcontinental railroad that would stand as a monument to pan-latin american talent and ambition and as a challenge to growing u.s. hegemony in the americas. the plan emerged in the context of the great depression, leading the u.s. to back away from decades of military intervention and paternalistic foreign relations while also REDACTEDalding the emergence of populism and mass political participation across most of latin america. for both bolivia and brazil, the plan served dual ends. on the one hand, it advanced dreams of latin american unity\\\\u2014ideas that took shape in the 1850s, but really emerged as a central theme among leading cultural figures across the region in the early 1900s. on the otREDACTED hand, and more practically, the plan was expected to link each country\\\\u2019s frontier to its central state as a prerequisite for the consolidation of a singular national identity. the project also served distinct needs that each country could fulfill for the otREDACTED\\\\u2014for brazil, the provision of bolivian oil to fuel its industrialization, for bolivia, access to the sea for its international trade. despite this promise, not only did the railroad project largely fail, but as REDACTED\\\\u2019s preliminary research already indicates, it led to a deepening of regional identities, which challenged the central state.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\ndominant interpretations have tended to explain this as a response to a cold war-era resurgence in u.s. hegemony (e.g. thomas field\\\\u2019s from development to dictatorship: bolivia and the alliance for progress in the kennedy era and james siekmeier\\\\u2019s the bolivian revolution and the united states, 1952 to the present) and in national debates about internal \\\\u201cotREDACTEDs\\\\u201d (e.g., laura gotkowitz\\\\u2019s a revolution for our rights: indigenous struggles for land and justice in bolivia, 1880\\\\u20131952 and kevin young\\\\u2019s blood of the earth: resource nationalism, revolution, and empire in bolivia). REDACTED\\\\u2019s inter-american approach questions both of these assumptions. first, in decentering the u.s., she argues for bolivian-brazilian relations during the 1930s and 1940s as the groundwork for responses to u.s. policy beginning in the 1950s. second, the fluid border encouraged by railroad construction produced migratory patterns that disquieted each country\\\\u2019s projects of cultural nationalism. REDACTED will achieve REDACTED dissertation\\\\u2019s aims by shifting the timeline and focusing on how local actors\\\\u2014natives and migrants, railroad workers and farmers, missionaries and more\\\\u2014struggled to define local and regional identities. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED\\\\u2019s project responds to what propelled REDACTED into our ph.d. program: a desire to take advantage of REDACTED language fluency in both spanish and portuguese and to exploring latin american projects of cultural nationalism within the context of the region\\\\u2019s inter-american relations. she began REDACTED relationship with bolivia during a study abroad program in cochabamba. following the natural lead of one of REDACTED family-stay companions, she turned to brazil, a country that has received an enormous migratory population from bolivia. this introduced REDACTED to questions of transnational latin american migration (ratREDACTED than the typically studied u.s.-latin american paths) and a host of questions not as readily explored in the literature. for REDACTED m.a. thesis, she carried out ethnographic research in s\\\\u00e3o paulo, brazil, looking at how brazilians conceptualized bolivians in their assertions of political citizenship and how generational divides among bolivians\\\\u2014from more recent arrivals to longtime residents\\\\u2014framed these identities. while a strong literature on these kind of generational challenges exists in the u.s.-latin american immigration literature, far less was known in this kind of inter-american context, especially one in which the borders between the countries had been so much more fluid. REDACTED facility in both spanish and portuguese allowed REDACTED to carry out interviews and engage in archival research. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nsince returning at the end of the summer from REDACTED research in bolivia and brazil, REDACTED is seeking support to complete REDACTED dissertation. she is a disciplined and independent writer who showed me REDACTED capacity in the writing, revising and resubmitting REDACTED diplomatic history article. given the work she accomplished while on REDACTED fulbright fellowship, i feel confident in REDACTED writing schedule and have no doubts about REDACTED anticipated spring 2021 defense.  i recommend REDACTED REDACTED for the aauw dissertation fellowship in the strongest terms possible. REDACTED has pursued linguistic fluency, grants-getting for research, research and publication\\\\u2014all in pursuit of a clear intellectual and professional trajectory.

Zoe also manages the rare feat of being an excellent student and someone whose warmth shines through seemingly naturally. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZoe was notably an exceptional student from the very start of the semester in which I met her.  She consistently scored between 95% and 100% on papers and exams.  She was always prepared for class, could sum up ideas clearly, and demonstrated a strong ability to analyze theories and concepts.  She worked well in group discussions, produced excellent written work, and volunteered to answer questions (often when no one else could or was willing).  She stood out among her classmates, some of whom had two more years of college experience.  I got the distinct feeling that Zoe can excel at anything she puts her mind to.  She is a student that I felt lucky to have in my classroom and whose opinion I always wanted to hear. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI believe much of the material we covered in class will prove beneficial for Zoe in her future medical career.  Urban Sociology covers issue of inequality and inequity in access to housing, healthcare, transportation, jobs, and social mobility.  Zoe\\\\u2019s in-depth understanding of these issues will enable her to empathize and communicate with people from a variety of different social backgrounds; an invaluable tool for engaging and aiding the patients who will rely on her in the future.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZoe also took a Social Science Research Design course with me in Fall 2020, in which she scored between 95% and 100% on all assignments and exams. Final assignments in this class entail students developing their own research proposal about a topic of their choosing.  Zoe developed a proposal about stress in contemporary life with a focus on the effects of the pandemic. Her methodology was impressive, she showed an excellent command of sampling techniques, and a sophisticated eye for selecting an appropriate method of data collection and analysis.

Our relationship spans three distinct periods. She was a talented and noteworthy graduate student of mine and others during a period of significant change at the University of Virginia School of Architecture. Like other grad students, she was a change agent who helped as several of us on the faculty worked to create a more progressive, inclusive, equitable, and diverse school in terms of racial diversity as well as related agendas that involve the public realm. I look back on those years with fondness and pride, and Kathleen was a student leader during that period. Secondly, I hired her as one of my first employees in a new community design and planning practice that I started called Renaissance Planning Group (the home firm was based in Orlando with transportation planning partners, while we created the design practice in Charlottesville). Among many noteworthy projects over several years working together, we won a Charter Award from the Congress for the New Urbanism for a 2,500 acre master plan and comprehensive plan amendment for Crozet, VA. Kathleen was a key member of my team (I was the project lead). More recently, and most importantly, I have followed her civic and political career with great interest. She has become the consummate citizen architect and she does our profession proud in her roles with the School Board, City Council and now she is running for Delegate from the Charlottesville district for the Commonwealth of Virginia legislature.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn reviewing her material, I am so pleased to see how she leveraged the work we did together for extensive impacts within the City of Charlottesville and beyond over the last fifteen years. As her mentor and someone who gave her a start in this area of practice, it gives me a special sense of pride. Our relationship really started when I founded the Charlottesville Design Resources Center, a non profit community design arm of the School of Architecture. She was my founding assistant director. She has taken this further with her work on Ending Poverty and other important initiatives for the City of Charlottesville. It is also noteworthy that she is extending her influence through teaching in the Planning Department at her alma mater. There are very few architects teaching in that program, so she is playing an important role in bringing design sensibilities to a discipline that hasn\\\\u2019t always emphasized the importance of design in their approach to problem solving with and for communities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShe is a brave and progressive voice in the public arena. While I do not agree with all of her positions, I have tremendous respect for the sincerity of her approach to public service. For the purpose of AIA Fellowship and frankly for all of us in the profession of architecture and education as well, we should honor any and all architects who take on these roles, whether we agree with their political positions or not. Her talents as an architect, urban designer, community planner, and engaged citizen work toward creating a better and more equitable place for all.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKathy Galvin is a very strong candidate for election to Fellowship of the AIA.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSincerely,\\\\r\\\\n \\\\r\\\\nKenneth Schwartz, FAIA\\\\r\\\\nProfessor of Architecture and Michael Sacks Chair in\\\\r\\\\nCivic Engagement and Social Entrepreneurship\\\\r\\\\nDirector of the Phyllis Taylor Center for Social Innovation and Design Thinking\\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 38',\n",

REDACTED met the challenge with diligence and invention.  she focused with specificity on a traditional grilling technique that interwove indoor and outdoor spaces with the working kitchen in a hybrid blend of south american and new orleanian open air cultures.  she maintained an impressive clarity of thought as her work progressed, to the degree that she included a sophisticated coding within the final model by deploying two wood-tones to define different spaces within the project.  her level of craft met her clarity of concept in a beautifully smooth way. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthis willingness to work so hard for a goal without preconception convinces me that she would apply himself with equal fervor in any new environment.  she contributed to critical discussions within the studio group and consistently modeled a laudable work ethic.  it is worth noting that REDACTED was on the varsity women\\\\u2019s golf team during her entire tenure at tulane.  she managed the difficult balance between demands on her time from academics and sport with maturity.  i believe this is a dedication that makes her a wonderful student of the architecture discipline.\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED has a great work ethic, attention to detail, and an aesthetic borne of intellectual curiosity.  she is fluent in three languages and inside and outside of the classroom REDACTED exhibits generosity paired with critical thinking and professional deportment.  \\\\r\\\\nshe would be a tremendous asset to your program, i highly recommend her for your consideration in this program.

She already had a strong interest in social and environmental impact, already having served as an intern with Liberty\\\\u2019s Kitchen, a youth development organization in New Orleans; the No Kid Hungry Campaign through Share Our Strength; and the Jane Goodall Institute. \\\\r\\\\nSophia and I have stayed in touch since she graduated, and I have been impressed with her internal motivation and initiative. When considering an advanced Public Health degree, Sophia took it upon herself to interview over a dozen graduate students and faculty members at different schools to learn more about each program she was considering\\\\u2014a skillset that will serve her well as a public health researcher! This research has helped Sophia really narrow her interests on your program, where she hopes to gain technical skills like lab techniques, GIS, data analysis, serve as TA, become involved with graduate research, work abroad, and focus on the intersection of environmental health/climate change and infectious disease. \\\\r\\\\nIt is no surprise that her current job is a Research Coordinator with the Henry M Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine. I am confident that she would apply her ability to problem solve, manage time, understand cancer research protocols, and work with a diverse team (doctors, lawyers, administrators) to her studies at your University and in her career as a public health professional. \\\\r\\\\nSophia has a high independent drive and is curious, passionate, and humble; she has a deep interest in learning about others and connecting with people different from herself. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSophia has pursued an impressive array of opportunities to better understand the world at large and apply her public health skills in the real world.

Zac\\\\u2019s participation in this program demonstrates his high level of commitment to social innovation. We met for four hours on eight separate Saturday mornings. Students receive no academic credit for their participation\\\\u2014they elect into the program for the sole purpose of better equipping themselves with skills to tackle pressing social and environmental challenges.   \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZac was committed, sincere, and most stands out in my mind for taking the initiative to form multiple campus and community partnerships to bring his venture to life. He partnered with multiple community organizations such as Capstone Community Gardens, an urban farm in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans; Joule Energy, a solar panel manufacturer; and World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, where Zac worked with greenhouse construction volunteers to launch a vertical farming prototype. On campus, Zac willingly took on a younger interested student as a partner and collaborator, offering mentorship and support to a budding social entrepreneur. Zac partnered with an architecture student to construct a visual representation of his greenhouse, and a former film student to create a short film representing the year\\\\u2019s work. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the end of the accelerator, Zac demonstrated the success of his vertical farming model in growing food using 95% less water than traditional methods, while distributing all of the produce grown to food banks in the Lower 9th Ward, an area categorized as a food desert. I was impressed that Zac managed to take on a full academic course load as a graduate student while launching Basil in his free time. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDue to his high level of engagement in CI, I was not surprised when Zac contacted me about his interest in applying to your MBA program in order to deepen his knowledge in what drives a successful business and gain a network from which he can launch future business endeavors. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZac\\\\u2019s leadership skills, creativity, personal drive, and business savvy mindset make him an ideal fit for your program.

Ruben is humble, yet driven and determined, constantly reframing challenges as potential opportunities for improvement and change.

i am confident that sue would be a tremendous addition to your diverse cohort of young changemakers. sue is very excited about knight-hennessy scholars because it is a diverse, collaborative program that unites students with eclectic interests from different disciplines who are eager to learn andinnovate together, mirroring the interdisciplinary education sue has crafted for REDACTEDelf at REDACTED: REDACTED is adouble liberal arts major in studio art and french with a psychology minor, in pre-medical studies, and used her dt (design thinking)taylor fellowship to explore human-centered approaches to problems in healthcare. her academic interests and accolades aside, she is south korean, but lived in mongolia for 11 years, california for four years, germany for two years, and louisiana for the past three years, and is both fascinated by and quite adept at navigating and learning from different cultures around the world.\\\\r\\\\nwhen sue began her fellowship at taylor, she was a bit shy and timid and i was extremely impressed (and surprised!) to see how she grew inher confidence and skill set to lead and teach others, even when working with older and more experienced students and adults. for example, through her involvement with the design for america chapter on campus, she created and facilitated a \\\\u201cdesign day\\\\u201d for medical students at louisiana state university school of medicine. while she is an aspiring medical student herself, sue took the reins and created a dt presentation and workshop for current medical students, facilitating a dynamic experiential workshop that included specific case studies of design thinking in healthcare. sue has stayed connected with the program and this year, she was asked to help build out more programming and curricula to bring more design thinking to medical students at lsu through nomi (new orleans medical innovators). at taylor, sue showed great initiative in helping design curricula for our fast 48 dtbootcamp and helped create new systems and structures for tracking our many design thinking requests and workshops. she also served as a team coach for a professional development workshop our center led with the advising department on campus. after the workshop, her team approached one of our staff members to share how impressed they were with her knowledge of the content andher calm, clear and helpful guidance. sue used her growing knowledge of dt and her calm, inquisitive nature to tackle real issues via her involvement with project ix, a dt initiative to find meaningful solutions to sexual violence \\\\r\\\\non campus. in this initiative, she helped design and build out a prototype for an interactive and educational online database with information on sexual health and on-campus resources. as an empathic person who aspires to be a physician, sue modeled deep listening and took great carein creating thoughtful solutions to this deeply personal and sensitive issue on campus. as sue grew in her position, i saw her become increasingly interested in expanding herknowledge in healthcare innovation and design thinking,as exemplified by herapplying to and receiving grants to attend the stanford-hosted conference, medicine x ed in april 2018.sue still raves about her experience, which she felt truly gave hera vision for the future of

attracts her to the knight-henessy program. while sue has encountered great successes at tulane, she has also navigated major hurdles. sue founded the student organization tulane gmi (green medicine initiative) to increase awareness around healthcare sustainability. her initial major goal was to implement a medical supply reallocation system in partnership with the afya foundation,who takes medical supplies that can still be used and reallocates them to supply poor areas around the world. as done by harvard gmi, sue hoped to bring this reallocation system to tulane. unfortunately, given university liability concerns regarding the handling of medical supplies, this was easier said than done. over a year and a half, sue navigated major troubleshooting issues , meeting countless times and communicating with the afya foundation, tu risk management \\\\r\\\\ndepartment, harvard gmi, student organization advisors, medical administration, tu general counsel, and the director of the student union. in the process, she learned that tulane would need a million-dollar insurance policy to launch this project. while certainly frustrating, sue saw this major setback as an opportunity to lead her organization back to their core mission statement (social and environmental healthcare sustainability)and see other avenues of fulfilling that mission, while continuing to troubleshoot the medical supply reallocation system. hence,sue led her team to both broaden and narrow their focus, designing an event called world water week, a weeklong event focused on the relationship between healthcare and water issues, such as global clean water access and local water infrastructure. they partnered with a great local organization, ripple effect, to discuss urban infrastructure, water literacy and healthcare access in new orleans. in this process, sue learned a great deal about focusing on the values of an organization and starting with a more place-based approach, pivoting to focus on local water infrastructure issues and its relation to healthcare access and agency, a very relevant topic in new orleans. sue and her team are now working on the second annual world water week and hoping to extend their partnership with ripple effect in considering how water literacy can affect one\\\\u2019s agency in accessing healthcare. in her continued involvement with tulane gmi, i was not only impressed with her ability to bounce back from major setbacks, but also to keep track of information, organize events, and align interests among other groups on campus. as is clear from sue\\\\u2019s positions with tulane gmi, project ix, her taylor fellowship and the wayin which she has crafted her tulane education, she has a service soul and is committed to \\\\r\\\\ndoing work that matters. sue is eager to bring a human-centered perspective to her work as a physician, and the knight-hennessy scholars program would give her the tools, mentorship, community dialogue, coaching and multidisciplinarynetwork of peers and educators to make this dream a reality.sue would be a phenomenal asset to your cohort. i highly recommend her for the knight hennessy scholars program, which wouldprovide her with a cohort community and space for collaborative dialogue and engagement across disciplines, while embedding her in a network and providing a stellar education that could chart her changemaking pathway for years to come.\", \"id\": 97',\n",

REDACTED demonstrated extraordinary intellectual curiosity and ethical fiber over the three years that i worked with REDACTED as an undergraduate student. i know that both REDACTED intellectual and ethical positions have continued to mature during his peace corps experience. REDACTED will be uniquely situated to pursue a law degree along with his intersecting interests inpublic policy, social justice, and environmental justice.i worked with elias REDACTED in his roles as an ignite pre-orientation coordinator and celt social innovation fellow.i distinctly remember meeting elias during his ignite interview. in particular, i was impressed by his ability to communicate and work across difference. elias is able to immediately put new people at ease, and he is able to help people connect across difference. i find this particularly admirable because elias also has very strong, and well-informed, convictions. elias could handily use his intellect to browbeat people who hold different viewpoints or are not as knowledgeable about a specific topic. instead, he meets people where they are at and values their contribution without compromising his own values.i find this strategy very effective in helping people understand multiple viewpoints, and this natural ability would be an asset in your classrooms.elias\\\\u2019 ability to communicate and work across difference was essential in his roles as an orientation coordinator and social innovation fellow. as an orientation coordinator, elias brought together a group of first-year students from around the countryand the world. during this weeklongimmersion, elias helped students develop relationships with peers and \\\\r\\\\nlearn more about their new home at tulane and in new orleans. elias was able to infuse his understanding of identity and relationship building throughout the ignite program. as a result, the programdoubled in size and was one of the highest rated pre-orientation experiences at tulane. additionally, elias co-presented the model with me at an international conference on social innovation in higher education.as a social innovation fellow, elias facilitated a social venture accelerator that supported undergraduate and graduate students with ideas for social change. in this role, elias reviewed the curriculum and programmatic strategy of previous semesters and provided recommendations to improve the diversity of participants, speakers, and mentors. additionally, elias infused more facilitationaround systems of oppression and critical analysis of the social or environmental problem. while elias was a second-year student during his fellowship, he was able to provide critical feedback and insight to students working on social and environmental issues that were pursuing a ph. d and had years of experience prior to their degree. elias consistently went above and beyond the requirements of the position in order to ensure a high-quality experience and articulateour ethical stance towards starting social ventures. that legacy continues today, with a social venture accelerator that values lived experience with the social or environmental issueand that prioritizes empathy, cultural humility, and accountability to constituents and communities.additionally, elias needed to financially support himself throughout college. throughout his rigorous course of study and extracurricular pursuits, elias worked 20-25 hours each week. as a graduating senior, he decided to work full-time while completing his coursework a semester early, in order to meet his personal financial needs. the semester after his early graduation, he continued to work full time and supplemented his tulane degree with courses in economics and statistics at a local community college. while financial stability was a high priority for elias, he successfully balanced that with his academic studies and social justice work. i have full confidence in his ability to continue to balance these needs in his graduate studies.elias garcia is one of the most intelligent, hard-working, and thoughtful students i have worked with over the last ten years. he carefully considers his contributions to society, \\\\r\\\\nand i know that he has put significantthought into pursuing a law degree at your institution. i am confident that he will succeed in your classes, and he will offer new insights and unique perspectives to his peers and professors\", \"id\": 107',\n",

traditional media, its pervasiveness suggests that there may be important contextual differences that alter its interpretation. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nher interest in this phenomenon lies in the reactions of users who are not the target of these insults. based on her review of the extant literature, she hypothesizes that, to the extent that the brand\\\\u2019s comments about the other users are funny, the transgressive social media posts from the brands leads observers to apply the expectations of human interactions to the behavior, and treat it as akin to the ribbing common between friends. this leads observers to feel more camaraderie with the brand, and furthers the development of the relationship between the brand and consumers. though this project is in its earlier stages, i have been impressed with ms. redacREDACTED\\\\u2019s rigor and diligence in her development of the experimental manipulations and design of the studies, ensuring that she is able to rigorously demonstrate the proposed relationships. i am exciredacREDACTED by this project because of the opportunity to explore it in both lab and real-world contexts, and its potential to have a broader impact on the academic world and to be applied by brand managers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nin addition to her research work, ms. redacREDACTED is passionate about fostering diversity among the academic community, as demonstraredacREDACTED by her involvement in the phd project. she has attended the phd project november conference and has been a student member of the marketing doctoral student association (mdsa), and has benefiredacREDACTED from the invaluable network provided by the phd project. she has also served as the mdsa planning committee\\\\u2019s communications liaison for the last two years, where she acredacREDACTED as a link between faculty, students, and the planning committee. her service included planning the yearly mdsa conferences, as well as creating a newsletter each semester that communicates to members about upcoming conference, along with workshop and journal submission information to help students further their academic careers. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthough it is still relatively early in her career as an academic, i am very exciredacREDACTED to see her mature and progress as a researcher and her commitment to the broader community is an indication of her quality as a magnanimous colleague and leader. it has been a pleasure to work with her, and i recommend her for the valuing diversity phd scholarship, enthusiastically and without reservation.\\\\r\\\\n\",

REDACTED as her instructor in my undergraduate consumer behavior course, which is a senior-level elective. i have worked with thousands of students in varying roles over my career, and i feel that ms. REDACTED is exceptional. as an undergraduate applying to graduate school, she is within the top 5% of students i have interacted with. ms. REDACTED\\\\u2019s impressive r\\\\u00e9sum\\\\u00e9 and collection of awards is a testament to her caliber, but these may not entirely capture some elements of her profile. in particular, i feel that her leadership, community orientation and academic quality are essential to understanding why she is an outstanding candidate for work in the legal field, and i have had the good fortune to see these first-hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\ni first came to know ms. REDACTED as a student in my consumer behavior class in fall 2020. only two weeks into the semester and having only briefly interacted with her to this point, she contacted me to ask if i would be willing to serve in an advisory role for the REDACTED REDACTED association\\\\u2019s the inclusion, diversity and equity (REDACTED) task force, on which she was a member. the goal of this committee was to investigate and understand the prevalence and nature of dei issues within the college REDACTED community, and to do so, conduct a survey of their members and compile a report. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\ni was immediately impressed with the confidence and professionalism she demonstrated in her request, where she made clear what the goal of the task force was, what their needs and timeline were, and how my skills would be beneficial. sensing her passion and the importance of the work, i readily agreed, in spite of having a busy semester of teaching. as i continued to interact with her, it became clear that others in the REDACTED task force were similarly impacted by her confidence. while in another context, it might almost be considered audacious, ms. REDACTED\\\\u2019s passion for serving the community and the clarity of purpose with which she pursues it affirms her boldness, and becomes infectious. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nwhile her ardor is part of what makes ms. REDACTED an effective leader, she is also mature enough to recognize she simply cannot play every role needed, and that to achieve her vision, she must rely on others. she is exceptional in her ability to recognize the strengths of the members of her network, and her focus on community service inspires those around her to commit to her vision, as well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nconcurrently, i also interacted with ms. REDACTED as her instructor. in the consumer behavior course, i emphasize theory and research heavily, and she responded well to this, asking questions and providing comments that indicated she had thoughtfully considered the readings and lectures. in our group case discussions, she confidently applied this abstract knowledge to real-world business problems, demonstrating her ability to connect the theoretical to the practical in a meaningful way. her performance in the classroom is all the more impressive when considered in light of her success in athletics. she is the captain of the REDACTED university REDACTED team, and was a multi-year conference champion. as i can attest from my own participation in collegiate athletics, academic success while managing the physical and mental demands of a full training load comes only to those who are well-organized and disciplined.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nit has been wonderful to work with ms. REDACTED, and i believe she is remarkably well suited to the legal profession. her leadership, community orientation, and intellectual quality all will serve her well as she moves forward in her career as an advocate for others. i recommend her enthusiastically and without reservation, as she will be an invaluable addition to your cohort. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 126',\n",

although we exchanged emails, we weren\\'t able to meet until the summer after her first year, first when i visited REDACTED\\'s hadrian\\'s villa excavation, and later when i invited her for dinner at the american academy in rome. i was instantly impressed with irene\\'s maturity; she seemed much more advanced than a first-year master\\'s student. she spoke easily and confidently about her ongoing work on the columbia project, as well as about her broader research interests. she appeared entirely comfortable in the intense social environment of the aar, chatting with senior scholars alongside artists and academics from a variety of disciplines. it was clear from those first meetings that she understood the field and was an excellent thinker and communicator. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nwhen i returned to teaching in spring 2020, irene joined my seminar, \\\\\"gender in roman archaeology.\\\\\" this course takes a broad approach to the theme of gender, using intersectionality as a theoretical framework not only to explore the experiences of ancient women, but also to consider issues of race, economic and legal status, imperialism, ability, and how these subjects are tied to the development of classical archaeology as a discipline as well as its place in the modern academy. irene was\\\\u2014without a doubt\\\\u2014the best student in the class. she brought thoughtful critique to the readings and discussions, always raising valuable points. although she acted as a leader, she did not dominate discussion and found ways to draw in other students, including the undergraduates in the class. she demonstrated that she is a creative as well as careful thinker, finding interesting connections between the course material. furthermore, irene was unphased by the upheaval of the spring 2020 semester, and her work did not suffer from our sudden shift online in the wake of covid-19. throughout the semester, she demonstrated her intelligence and capability to work at the highest levels, even in the midst of significant external stressors. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nirene\\'s research project in the seminar likewise was exceptional. she wrote on the fresco of a woman painting priapus from the house of the surgeon in pompeii, a scene that most often has been used to illustrate women\\'s lives and activities in the city. undertaking an interdisciplinary analysis that moved confidently between a contextual reading of the house\\'s full decorative scheme and an adept treatment of the carmina priapea, irene argued that the scene was meant to be funny. rather than a genre scene drawn from life, she convincingly presented the painting as a burlesque image that inverted standard models of gendered behavior. her paper was good enough that i encouraged her to submit it as an abstract for the 2021 annual meeting of the archaeological institute of america, the first time i have prompted a student to present a seminar paper at a major venue. i was not surprised when it was accepted. as i write this letter, the meeting has yet to happen, but i have no doubt that irene\\'s presentation will be excellent, and that her argument will be well-received. with continuing refinement, i could even see the paper becoming an article, and i believe it clearly shows her potential to make valuable contributions to the field. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nas her research in the seminar indicated, one of irene\\'s key strengths is her ability to move between the disciplines of classics; her argument on the house of the surgeon required her to step deftly between archaeological, art historical, and philological approaches. she received excellent training in art history and classics at columbia. at tulane, where we focus primarily on language courses for master\\'s students, she excelled in both ancient and modern languages. she has worked for the hadrian\\'s villa project for three seasons, including in a leadership role training new excavators. having heard how well she did there, i had hoped to bring her onto a new excavation in summer 2020; those plans were interrupted by the global health crisis, but i would be very happy to have her on a field team in the future. she also has done laboratory work at knossos with my colleague emilia oddo, who tells me that she performed well there, even while studying material far outside her primary area of interest. in sum, she is positioned to succeed in any graduate program and has all the building blocks of an outstanding future career. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nher personality also suggests that irene would make strong contributions to berkeley\\'s graduate community. she is kind and funny, remaining focused even under stress. she does not seem inclined towards drama or outbursts, and was a favorite of both faculty and students at tulane. i am certain that she would become a valuable part of your program. additionally, she has been working as a middle school latin teacher through the pandemic, a position that i expect will leave her with even more maturity and perspective as she moves back into academia. for all these reasons, i recommend irene in the very highest terms. please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.  \\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 142',\n",

REDACTED was a student in \\\\\"gender in roman archaeology\\\\\" in the spring of 2020. this course takes a broad approach to the theme of gender, using intersectionality as a theoretical framework not only to explore the experiences of ancient women, but also to consider issues of race, economic and legal status, imperialism, ability, and how these subjects are tied to the development of classical archaeology as a discipline as well as its place in the modern academy. REDACTED was an excellent member of the class who stood out as a natural leader. she always came prepared with insightful discussion points and thoughtful questions. most impressively, she had a keen understanding of when the discussion had started down unproductive tangents, and i could count on her to intervene with new questions or to raise more focused points. of course, her attempts were not always successful in the midst of a talkative and opinionated group of seminar students, but she showed a sensitivity to the structure of class sessions that many students lack. given the timing, i also was able to see how REDACTED handles a crisis; our class was interrupted (literally) by the announcement that REDACTED would cancel in-person instruction and move online due to covid-19, a transition that caused considerable struggles for students of all levels. REDACTED showed resilience throughout the semester; her work never suffered in the upheaval and she appeared to weather the changes with few ruffled feathers. above all, REDACTED strikes me as a steady person who clearly articulates her goals and continues moving towards them regardless of external circumstances. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthe research project she completed in the seminar also suggests that REDACTED is well prepared for continuing work at the graduate level. her paper examined motifs of breastfeeding in art from rome and the provinces, arguing against past ideas that breastfeeding marked a particularly \\\\\"provincial\\\\\" attitude towards family and children to contend that representations of the act appear also in the capital, in depictions of mortals as well as gods. rather than focusing on differences between center and periphery, she traced meaning through the commissioner of the work: mothers themselves, or others seeking to represent motherhood. the paper showed a good command of the roman material, particularly considering that REDACTED\\'s primary research interests are in aegean prehistory. her writing improved over the course of the semester, and while she still has some work to do in that regard, i have no doubt that she will continue to grow in ease and technique. she is a hard worker and very teachable, with a deep intellectual curiosity. she also has a clear idea of the goals of research in our field, which seems to me the best predictor of success at this stage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nlooking beyond the seminar, REDACTED\\'s preparation is well-rounded. college of REDACTED and cya provided her with a broad interdisciplinary foundation in classics and classical archaeology, and she has participated in good field projects. at REDACTED, she does well in her greek and latin classes and is making good progress in both german and french. she has not been a teaching assistant for any of my classes, but my colleagues report that she is mature and capable in that position. she has been a valuable member of our graduate community, and i believe she would do the same at REDACTED. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nwith her interests in prehistory, REDACTED is particularly drawn to REDACTED for its historic and current excellence in that area. she also has experience with community outreach and hopes to continue public-facing scholarship along with her other pursuits, and so is excited by the prospect of contributing to the outreach program. as a uc alumna, i believe she would be a good fit for the department. she is well-prepared by her past experiences and has all the qualities that suggest future success. for these reasons, i do not hesitate to recommend her.     \\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 143',\n",

REDACTED\\\\u2019s responses to the material are intelligent and original, and he is at ease working with even the densest readings. the course also requires a major independent research project. REDACTED\\\\u2019s project on depictions of children and childhood in roman art has been excellent so far, and i fully expect the final paper to be among the best in the class. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED is a model student, and as director of undergraduate REDACTEDin the department of REDACTED studies, i can confirm that his performance has been equally excellent in my colleagues\\\\u2019 courses. furthermore, he is a genuinely kind and interesting person; i greatly enjoy interacting with him both inside and outside the classroom setting. it is for all these reasons that i recommend him in the highest terms. please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 145',\n",
       " '\"gender\": 0, \"content\": \"i am writing to recommend REDACTED REDACTED as REDACTED\\\\u2019s nominee for this year\\\\u2019s REDACTED and REDACTED scholarships. REDACTED was a student in my advanced classical studies seminar, \\\\u201cgender in roman archaeology,\\\\u201d in the spring semester of 2017. she is an engaged and dedicated student with excellent academic skills and well-developed knowledge of the field of archaeology. i have every reason to believe that she would benefit enormously from the opportunity to study in britain, while also representing the best of REDACTED and contributing to the social and intellectual environments of both the uk and america. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED was one of the youngest students in the gender in roman archaeology course, and i was concerned in the beginning that she might fall behind her classmates, most of whom were seniors and graduate students. my fears were unfounded. we met once a week, and the students were asked to complete ca. 80-100 pages of reading \\\\u2014 typically 4 or 5 complex academic articles \\\\u2014 for each meeting. small groups of 3-4 students led each class, preparing discussion questions, guiding discussion, and providing any necessary supplementary material. in addition, each student completed his or her own semester-long research project related to the study of roman women using archaeological techniques. REDACTED was one of the strongest students in the class from the beginning. she contributed interesting ideas about the readings, regularly finding points of connection between them as well as between our weekly topics. she proved herself to be a critical reader, but did not fall into the trap of becoming overly negative; she was able to assess both the positive and negative points of arguments. likewise, she did not hesitate to challenge classmates\\\\u2019 points of view, but always did so kindly and fairly, and was willing to listen and change her mind. in short, she was a valuable member of the class who worked to build a positive and productive academic environment.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nin her semester-long research, REDACTED also excelled. she chose to work on women in the roman provinces, focusing on the role of women in athens, greece both prior to and following roman conquest. her experience in the anthropology department was clear in the work, which was theoretically informed but grounded in evidence, both literary and archaeological. she argued that the influence of roman culture on athens brought new freedoms to women, but at the same time prompted a conservative response that attempted to curtail those freedoms, particularly in the political realm. her final paper demonstrated her skill in weaving together diverse information, from ancient texts and myth, to law codes, to civic and domestic architecture. it showed a sophistication that indicated she is well prepared for graduate work and a future in academia.    \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED aims to continue her exploration of cultural change in the roman provinces through graduate study in britain. by studying culture contact in a very different part of the roman world, the british frontier, she will continue to develop themes that she has carried from her extensive work in american archaeology. she will benefit particularly from the theoretical focus that defines archaeology in the uk, since her interests are complex and require well-thought out and articulated theoretical underpinnings. i have no doubt that earning those ma degrees will push her work in directions she would not have the opportunity to pursue in america, while preparing her well to return here for her phd. at the same time, i am sure that she will benefit her future academic departments, making real contributions to the intellectual life of her home and adopted countries. it is for all of these reasons that i am happy to support REDACTED, who is truly an outstanding example of the best of REDACTED. \\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 146',\n",
       " '\"gender\": 0, \"content\": \"i am writing to recommend REDACTED REDACTED for admission to the REDACTEDum seminar (REDACTED) internship program at the REDACTED. i REDACTED REDACTED this fall, when she transferred to REDACTED university and began a classical studies major. REDACTED\\'s path through academia has not been traditional; she has REDACTED twists, turns, and roadblocks that most of our students at REDACTED never experience. rather than undermining her, however, that path has strengthened her drive and sharpened her focus. REDACTED is intelligent, mature, detail-oriented, and exceptionally capable. she is an excellent candidate for the REDACTED program, and i recommend her in the highest terms. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nREDACTED graduated high school in 2012 and immediately entered university of REDACTED. after less than a month, however, several personal issues forced her to rethink her plans and question her goals. she left college and worked in retail for the next five years. even in that setting, her maturity, organization, and intelligence shone through, and she moved quickly into management positions. although she was successful in that field, her desire to continue her education never faded, and she began to attend a local community college in 2017. she shone in the academic setting, where she was able to engage a longstanding interest in history and material culture. while taking classes, she also worked as an intern for a local REDACTEDum, a position that solidified her desire for a future in REDACTEDum studies. based on her excellent performance at her community college, REDACTED was admitted to REDACTED beginning in fall 2020. in her first semester, she achieved a 4.0 gpa, a clear statement of her capabilities made even more impressive given the upheavals of the current global pandemic. in a semester during which most students struggled, REDACTED remained calm and focused. her performance suggests her maturity and her ability to persevere through difficult experiences. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nas a student in my class, \\\\\"pompeii: life in a roman town,\\\\\" REDACTED stood out for her intelligence and command of the material. the course asks students to \\\\\"read\\\\\" complex material culture and engage with high-level scholarship, tasks that many find difficult. REDACTED never faltered; she was the strongest student in the class from the first week and maintained that position throughout the semester. her thinking is clear and detailed; she easily understands even difficult readings and although she hasn\\'t had much formal training in writing, her foundations are good. this semester, she is taking my upper-level seminar, \\\\\"gender in roman archaeology,\\\\\" a class reserved for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. there, our focus is on writing, and i am confident that she will make great strides. i also believe the course, which is entirely discussion-based, will be valuable for increasing her confidence among her peers. REDACTED comes from a very different social, economic, and educational background than most of our students at REDACTED, and that difference can shake her confidence, despite her abilities. i already have seen her make progress in this area in the pompeii course; although she started the semester clearly nervous about speaking in front of the group and rarely participated in discussions, by the end she typically led small group discussions and almost always contributed to the full class. given her natural abilities and the clarity of her goals, i have every confidence that she will continue to grow in these areas. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nin sum, i see REDACTED\\'s untraditional background as a strength; her experiences have reinforced her skills and solidified her ambitions. i am certain that her intelligence and maturity would make her an excellent member of the REDACTED program. one of her primary interests is in using REDACTEDum studies to further issues of social justice, a goal that she began pursuing in her previous REDACTEDum internship. through historic and contemporary collections, she seeks to highlight voices that have been silenced, an area that is particularly relevant to the current moment and through which she might make key contributions at the REDACTED. on a personal note, REDACTED also would be a fantastic member of the cohort socially; she is funny, kind, and laid-back. she makes friends easily and as her past shows, can adapt resourcefully even to significant upheavals in her life. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\non that theme, i would like to emphasize the lifechanging affect that a program like the REDACTED internship can have on a student like REDACTED. she absolutely has the ability to work in a premiere REDACTEDum, but the REDACTED (and the city of REDACTED) would be an entirely new world for her. i have no doubt that she would thrive there as she has at REDACTED. her background (and success) in retail means that she already knows how to interact with the public; the opportunity to do so at the REDACTED would build her confidence and show her that she can pursue the life she aspires towards. the internship would be a turning point that would open new paths and opportunities; she already has the necessary skills and training to take advantage of those, and her time at the REDACTED would equip her with even more expertise. for all of these reasons, i recommend REDACTED fully and enthusiastically. please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions. \\\\r\\\\n\", \"id\": 147',\n",
