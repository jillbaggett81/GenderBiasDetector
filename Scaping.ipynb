Dr. Baaj glibly apologized after the surgery and passed me along to a pain management doctor that was affiliated with his hospital. I don’t think he could have cared less about the condition he left me in. I would never consider using Dr. Baaj for surgery and follow-up treatment.

       " 'Dr. Baaj operated on me in August 2019 for a rare condition called Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis (SEL). This is accumulation of fatty deposits in the spinal column and presents as numbness in the lower extremities. The operation involved a laminectomy of the thoracic spine, debridement of the lipomas surrounding the spinal cord, followed by thoracic fusion. The level of skill and precision for such an operation is beyond my comprehension. Everything turned out just fine and I was back at work in 8 weeks. Dr. Baaj was straightforward and empathetic at all times, even sparing me the fact that the operation was \"very risky\" until after the fact to spare me the fear and anxiety about a procedure that had to be performed. Over one year out, I am pain-free and the numbness in my feet is receding as nerves regenerate. Almost every day, I say to myself \"Thank you, Dr. Baaj\"!': 'Male',\n",
