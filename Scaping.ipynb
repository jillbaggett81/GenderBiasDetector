Today I went for my epidural injection, without sedation, done by Dr. Aarons and I cannot believe the difference. Dr. Aarons talked me thru the whole procedure and as I was bracing for the pain, he simply said, ok we are all done!!!! There was little to no pain and I'm more than satisfied with my experience.

His clinical coordinator, Darryl, is also very professional, has a wonderful way of making his patients feel comfortable and is very efficient at keeping the office running smoothly.

He then copied and pasted her information and findings into his own progress note without making any medical decisions himself.  He failed to review my cardiac test results, lab work, scans, heart cath, etc.  He ordered blood work and an EKG which were performed on the same day as my office visit  and never provided me with any results.  50 minutes into the appointment, he began looking at his watch and announced he had other pts to see.  21  days following my appointment he finally dictated a progress note.
