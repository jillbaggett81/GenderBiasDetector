He is professional yet compassionate, and obviously knows his specialty inside and out.   I would recommend him to everyone, especially to those I care about!!!

"Dr Aaberg diagnosed my ocular melanoma. When I was referred to him they got me in quickly.
 Dr Aaberg spent until after 8pm in his office talking with my family and me. He was courteous, compassionate and was willing to spend as much time as we needed to get our questions answered.
 He talked about treatment options explaining in detail the reason he recommended plaque radiation therapy.",Male
"I've been going to Dr. Aaby since I was a kid. I have a severe astigmatism and I need prism for my lenses. He gets it on the dot every time. For people without difficult eyes getting glasses isn't a problem.. For me, it's very complicated... I didn't know how complicated it was til I couldn't afford the cost of going to him and the glasses... Down on my luck I tried other places.. They proceeded to screw up my glasses many times. 
          If you have a difficult prescription I recommend staying with Dr. Aaby.. He will definitely get it right for you.",Male
"Referred by our Peditrican (who is exceptional) for an evaluation. My son has a known medical problem with his eyes. Dr. Aaby was unprofessional, dismissive, and did not explain his exam results, other than  providing a stronger prescription. I still dont know what my sons vision is, which we need for his IEP. HORRIBLE experience. we will never go there again. 
 (the office staff was great, Dr. Abby should take note and learn from them) ",Male
Dr Aaby is very thorough and explains everything in words I can understand. ,Male
"Very caring. Extremely knowledgeable, he explained everything both before and after. He called the day of surgery to make sure everything was okay. ",Male
Would not recommend. My child went undiagnosed with an eye condition any layman could spot. It was a traumatic first appointment and we felt like he was just annoyed with my child crying and rushed us out the door insisting nothing was wrong. Gave him a 2nd chance and went back again and still he said it was nothing abnormal. Ended up going elsewhere and we got a diagnosis and a treatment plan.,Male
"Most friendly and profession facility! Other health places I have used I have waited up to over an hour past my appointment time to even be called back. Lincoln Surgical waved me back right on my appointment time. Dr. Aach listened to everything I needed to discuss. Physician and staff all were very friendly, prompt and professional. Highly recommend!",Male
My experience with Dr Aach is excellent. I'm being treated for a thyroid problem and he has my complete trust. He is straightforward and caring. Dr Aach is very easy to talk to. ,Male
"Dr. Aach performed my wife's gall bladder removal a few years ago.  He is a skilled surgeon, and the surgery went well, but he is bed side manner is horrible.  He seemed annoyed to have to operate on a patient that is overweight.  He made several rude comments about it over the course of her care.  A surgeon is more than just his skill, he is also a caregiver, and should act accordingly.",Male
"His clinic stopped prescribing medication mid 2018.  He was a good doctor who subcommed to DEA pressures.  So unfortunate that pain doctors, let alone medi-cal pain doctors, are increasingly hard to find for patients who really need legitimate pain management.",Male
BS,Male
"I love dr Aachi he maybe a busy dr but he knows his patients and knows their needs . He really understood my pain and suffering better any dr I’ve seen!!!!
",Male
Horrible scheduling and receptionist. There is NO WAY to contact this clinic other than leaving voice mails on his numerous google voice accounts; which is down right showing ZERO compassion towards the patients!!,Male
"Worst Doctor I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. Never spent more than 5 minutes with me, and during that 5 minutes he was on the phone being rude to other patients. A real dirt bag.",Male
"Dr. Aachi seems like a very busy-body but do not worry. He is DEFINITELY paying attention to every word you say. 

I very much appreciate that he not only listens but understands my concerns. He is helping me achieve my goal it took my previous doctor 2 years to barely embrace. I am post-chemo and in constant pain however I do no want to end up dependent on pain meds, so the 1st visit he already came up with a plan for me to live a healthy and uncompromising life. Thank you, Dr. Aachi!",Male
"I just Love Dr Aachi!! He is wonderful as my pain management Doctor! He is using Acupunture to help with my severe low back pain (compression fractures/Osteoporosis). He is helping me get off the strong pain killers. I have been a longtime patient of another doctor who only just kept prescribing higher doses of very strong medications! Never offered anything like Acupunture, it's so wonderful!!! It gives my pain a way out of my body! Not just masking the pain thru the fog of heavy narcotics!!! ",Male
Dr. Aachi really listens to me and really trys to help me.,Male
"Dr. Aadalen repaired my left rotator cuff before Tria was established.  He seened caring and sincere.  Two years later at newly created Tria, he repaired my right rotator cuff.  I returned a few months later with issues. After long waits (including him chatting up nurses outside my exam room) he seemed indifferent to my problems and said if I had any more issues don't return - call his assistant.  Difference? I had private insurance for first surgery and Medicare for second.  Money talks...",Male
I went to Dr. Aadalen for both my ACL/MCL tear and my torn labrum. Both surgeries have far exceeding my expectations in recovery time and mobility.  There are additional repairs I would like completed on my other shoulder and knee and will definitely be returning to Dr. Aadalen. ,Male
"Dr Aadalen repaired my torn rotator cuff in 2013. He did am amazing job! Throughout, he made sure I understood what needed to happen for the procedure to be a success. I regained full range of motion, full strength and have had no problems since. Tria was fast, efficient and patient focused",Male
Not helpful - said my middle finger on my right hand was fractured - told him I was in pain - said I'd just have to deal with it - really? $250 for that?!,Male

"I am extremely fortunate to have had Dr. Abdul Aadom perform non invasive ERM  to remove a very large polyp on the right side, ascending wall of my colon in lieu of surgical removal of a part of my colon.      I am a 73 year old woman who was warned of risk due to the location and size of the colon.    Because of Dr. Aadam's skill there were no negative side effects.    I am so relieved and thankful to have Dr. Aadam as my doctor and also to be guided by his nurses, Nancy and Eileen.    Also, Dr. Aadam associates were not only professional but reassuring in their professionalism and caring.   I would highly recommend Dr. Aadam.    I am so appreciative.",Male
"When a gastro at another hospital recommended I have my colon removed, I can't tell you how relieved I was to find the voice of reason and compassion in Dr. Aadam. He put me at ease, which wasn't a simple thing considering how upset I was. He was patient with me and answered all my questions (and there were a lot). I didn't need to have my colon removed, no thanks to the other gastro. I trust Dr. Aadam implicitly and appreciate his kind care and expertise. He and Linda Feldman are a great team!",Male
Really explaines things and gives you time to ask questions. Very caring,Male
"When I think about what I am grateful for this holiday season,  it is the team of Dr. Aadam and Linda Feldman RN.  They were so kind and through and treated me as though they knew me for years.  They were both so caring and professional.

When I read about Dr. Aadamm  his credentials were amazing.  He studied in Japan to learn this endoscopic submucosal procedure which is so specialized.  I feel very lucky that Dr. Aadam preferred this procedure.

Thank you so much.

"She is the only doctor I will miss at Kaiser. She was excellent with helping manage my chronic illness symptoms, and made sure that I got the most accurate treatment that was best for my health. She issued tests on a proactive basis and explained my illness to me at 27 in a way no one did for me when I was diagnosed at 15.",Female
"I have been going to Dr. Aafreen for years now, and she is the ultimate patient advocate. She is always very attentive, realistic, and doesn't push unnecessary tests and procedures. She was the first OB/GYN that I had went to at Kaiser who asked me a number of questions on my condition and really got to the underlying causes of my chronic condition. Very grateful for her.",Female
"Our family was fortunate enough to call Dr. Aagard Our doctor  for many years prior to our moving to Colorado.  He delivered our three sons and cared for us for 10 years. At all times Dr. Aagard was compassionate, respectful, generous, and truly involved and interested in our family’s well-being. We are so very grateful for  having been his patients!  Dr. Aagard is a teacher- he makes sure you understand your diagnosis, what you can do to care for yourself, what your treatments options are,  and then he is sure to follow up.

Very nice lady. Knows a lot. ,Female
"I recently had a visit with Dr. Aagard for severe pain I was experiencing in my uterus, unexplainable cramping, stabbing pains in my ovaries and off cycle bleeding. He had a lack of concern about my pain and told me my uterus and ovaries felt fine, which to him i'm sure they did but knowing my body and what feels normal I know something is not right. He made me feel like I was wasting his time being there because I was just bleeding and shouldn't be concerned about it. To finish off my less than pleasant visit he told me that if I was tired of bleeding I (a 20 year old, single, broke college student) could 'just get pregnant' and that would stop my bleeding for nine months. This was less than professional of him, and I will not be going back.",Male
He spent time explaining things and was very kind and compassionate!,Male
"I recently saw Dr. Aagensen after 3 years of constant pain in my S-I joint and lower back. When she came into the room, she introduced herself by her first name and began listening intently to every word of my history. She asked intelligent questions and made keen observations. It only took her about 20 minutes to diagnose my issue and demonstrate a series of stretches and exercises to correct my problem. She was spot on. Within two days, I was nearly pain free! She has given me back my life!",Female
"I left a previous review as a former patient, former due to distance. I’ve now gone back to him and willingly travel 100 miles one way to see him. Dr. Asker is one of the most conscientious and caring doctors I’ve ever known. He performed my cornea transplants and cataract surgery and now treats my glaucoma. His office staff are all friendly, yet professional as well.",Male
"We are so thankful for Dr. Aaker’s guidance.  We would have been lost without without him.  Our daughter had a terrible stye that became infected. 
We saw 4 different ophthalmologists before seeing  Dr. Aaker.  All four told us how to treat the infection, but also told us there was nothing that could be done about the swelling.  Dr. Aaker, on the other hand, recommended an effective treatment for both, and it worked very quickly.  My daughter said it best — “Dr. Aaker is the best doctor in the",Male

"i was a patient of Dr Aaker a few years ago when he was in Temple, Tx.  I was deeply saddened when he left Scott &amp; White.  I consider him to be one of the finest Ophthamologist EVER.!!

Welcome back to central Texas Dr. Aaker.",Male

"I recently took my son to see Dr. Aaker in Georgetown. He and his staff were very friendly and helpful.  I have been taking my son to vision therapy for over a year when I decided to see an actual opthamologist about his condition. Dr. Aaker did a thorough job with his eye exam. He's also great with kids!  He even called a friend who is a pediatric ophthalmologist to discuss his condition further.  It helped to put my ""mom fears"" at ease. I highly recommend Dr. Aaker to anyone!",Male
Dr Aaker took his time and was very thorough in his examination.  I would recommend him.  ,Male

"I had high hope for help from Dr. Aalami I have had continuous pain for months, and was referred to him for help. Dr Gould was only interested in ensuring that I knew he would not prescribe pain medication, and I would just have to live with the pain.

"He did the leg bypass which failed, then amputated it",Male

Dr. Aalbers is an AMAZING doctor!! He actually listened to my son and explained his thoughts well with graphics and images. He is very relatable! We highly recommend him!!!,Male
I got to the office they took me to a room. Ab 15 latter a office person came in to the room and said dr Aalbers. Look at my history and said I was too complicated and did not want to deal with me. He did not even have the decency to come tell me himself. This was my second trip to that office in one day being promised I was going to see him. The could have called and told me so I did not have to make a second 25 min drive wasting gas to get there. I am still awaiting on an apology from him but wait Doctors can do no wrong nothing is there fault. So I am not expecting an apology bc he even had his office person tell me. Time to man up DrAalbers And take Responsibly and admit when you’re wrong and Be a good human and apologize.,Male

He has made a hugely positive impact on my son, and we feel so blessed to have found him.",Male
"Dr. Aalbers was incredible. He was able to quickly identify our daughter's condition, but didn't stop with just a diagnosis. He spent time discussing treatment options and explained things about the condition that we had never realized were connected. It was obvious that he is extremely well versed in identifying and treating neurological conditions. My daughter was moved to tears knowing that she finally found someone who understood and recognized what she has been going through. I can't recommend him enough. He is a rare find in today’s medical industry.",Male

"Dr. Aalbers staff were professional, kind, and helpful. Dr. Aalbers nurse let me know he was running about 15 minutes late. She wanted to make sure that was OK with our schedule.

Dr. Albers had a great bedside manner and took the time we needed to answer any and all questions.",Male
"Dr Aalbers helped save our daughter's life. He could see she was failing her first epilepsy med and he knew the statistics that she would fail the next and the next.

"Dr.  Aalbers is one of our Angels here on earth.  He has been the only Dr. out of many we have seen that really listens to parents' concerns and takes them seriously, discusses family history in detail, and looks at the whole picture.  He is the only Dr. who really looked at my child's movement and saw the  problems I had reported and added some to our list.  He was willing to test for rare conditions that could be an underlying cause, found that condition, and eliminated it with correct meds.
",Male
"He explained the pros and cons of surgery well.  My surgery went without a hitch.  His enthusiasm when I asked him to explain the pictures taken of my shoulder showed me he truly loves what he does.  I was also very impressed with the office visits.  They were always efficient and on time, yet he gave me the information I needed.",Male
" Dr Aalderink really does want to help his patients and he expresses great enthusiasm toward that goal. That said, I feel that in my particular case, he was far too hasty to prescribe surgery. I had chronic hip pain for which I was hoping he could help. I was open to but hoping to avoid surgery. He performed what he assured me would be a minor exploratory procedure. In actuality he reshaped part of the bone in the joint which led to more pain and new cracking and popping in the area. Not pleased",Male
"After going through several months of PT, my therapist recommended me to see a surgeon and Dr. Aalderink was close to where I live and work. I appreciated his approach to my shoulder issue and his willingness to try things other than surgery first. After continued pain and loss of function, I decided to have the surgery. He did an excellent job explaining the process both before the surgery and after. He also was able to take care of a fairly major injury that had not shown up on the MRI.",Male

I was hesitant to have more surgery, but couldn't go on the way I was. Within 4 months of my first appt, I'd had revisions on both hips. I'm now back to my sport &amp; pain free!

"Doctor is verbally abusive and regularly makes several verbal jabs at me to attempt to provoke a fight and has several times over threatened to lay hands on me. To which I've been several times to warned him if he does, hes going to be pinned and held down until the MP's on NMCP come and take an innocent report then arrest him, and I would be filing for charges. Next Innocent will be reported just to start a trail of evidence.  ",Male
"Dr. Aaltonen is an excellent doctor and I couldn't recommend him highly enough to any patient who is looking for a great biopsy MD. I have a complex medical history and he explained my liver biospy (that he consequently performed),  with complete fully detailed precision  and care. He answered all of my many questions. I can firmly say that I wouldn't let anyone else perform this one on me! He was excellent in his both his skills during the procedure and follow up immediately after. ",Male
"If zero stars were available, I’d give him zero stars.  Disgrace to his profession.  Arrogant, dismissive, condescending...you know, all of the qualities that describe a garbage doctor.  I’m not a “seeker” or anyone that enjoys the attention given for being sick.  However, this clown treated me like a nuisance...despite my history and observable/quantifiable evidence.  Guess what?  He was wrong.  Shocker.  Despite my pleas, I was discharged and given a generic prescription.  His prescription might as well have been gasoline on the fire.  Lo and behold, who was back at the ER and admitted the following day?  Good guess...me!  Admitted for 4+ days.  This “doctor” is a complete (censored) and ought to be ashamed of himself.  I’m gonna venture a guess and say this post will neither have zero effect on his treatment of patients nor matter to him personally.  Arrogance is predictable.  Advice?  Easy...request a new doctor.",Male
"I was taken to Baylor Grapevine for a broken arm. My insurance company showed Baylor as in network. I even asked if it was in network when I checked in and confirmed. Mr ""A"" ended up billing me out of network for more than my entire ER visit. He is untrustworthy.",Male
Dr. Aalund is kind and considerate. He is not the type of doctor to act dismissive or treat patients like inconveniences. He will sit with you for ages explaining your condition and arrive at the most logical and caring course of treatment. I wish more physicians were like him.,Male

Having been newly diagnosed with pre-diabetes from my PCP, I have been doing my research and already changed my diet for the better before my appointment with Dr. Aamir.

"I really like Dr. Aamir. I had to wait in the waiting room for about 40 minutes, so I didn't like that, but once I was with Dr. Aamir I understood why. He spent a lot of time with me and asked me many questions. He was thorough and I felt he really cared about my well-being. Not once did I feel he was rushing me to finish up my appointment. I felt like a person rather than a number. I will take 40 minutes waiting any day for a doctor as patient and kind as him!",Male
He does not listen and leaves dosages of treatment medication up to me since I am a rn. I am not an endocrinologist whatsoever and just because I do have knowledge doesn't mean I know how to treat my disease. He is very lazy in his approach and recently when I tried to get an appointment with him he refused to see me saying my case is too complicated for him and wouldn't even see me. ,Male
I like him very much!,Male
He is always totally concerned about helping his patients.,Male
Dr. Aamlid replaced both of my knees and I couldn't be more happy with having him as my doctor.  Never have I had a doctor who spends the time with a patient making sure that everything is ok and making sure everything is going ok.  I would recommend him to anyone who needs to have a total knee replacement done.  He's the greatest,Male
Dr. Aamlid has replaced both of my knees and one of my husband's knees... I cannot think of anyone I would recommend more than him... He and his staff go above and beyond to first evaluate the necessity of your knee replacement and then inform you of what will happen both before and after surgery and to follow up with making sure your rehab is going as it should.. both me and my husband are back to doing everything we want to do and cannot thank Dr. Aamlid and his staff enough!!,Male
"Dr. Aamlid did my ""total joint replacement"" surgery (a new knee) 12 days ago, and I am doing GREAT!  My Physical Therapist tells me that I am at the SIX WEEK post-op therapy stage!  No more walker; no more cane; I am now walking like a PRO &lt;3  Thank you SO much Dr. Aamlid...for the first time in four years, I am feeling like I can walk ""normally.""  You are the BEST &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",Male
"Dr. Aamodt is the best!  Very concerned about my health. I never feel like she's rushing me. She takes time to listen to my concerns. The nurses return my calls within 24 hrs. Nurse Terri! That's my girl! She's like a girlfriend. Fun to talk to, patient &amp; caring as well. She &amp; Dr. Aamodt make an awesome team. I have no need to  go elsewhere &amp; I've seen Dr. Aamodt for years. She's the best!",Female
Very caring concerned about her patients. Very highly recommend!,Female
"Dr. Aamodt, her nurses Terri and Shawnee are an awesome team. I ended up getting sick and they all treated me like I was their own family member. From the first call to the office visit, I was shown a great deal of compassion and care. I was not treated like a number in which in this day and age there are a ton of demands put on Physicians and their nurses,,which leaves them on a very strict time crucnh.  I am truly grateful for Dr. Aamodt and her team.",Female
Nurses are disrespectful they call with attitudes and when u tell them u are not feeling well they don’t care.... They relay information from doctor without reasoning and tell you that you have no reasoning to be off from work....,Female
Does not follow up with requests to help the patient.,Female
"I was not impressed. I will give credit where credit is due, he preformed my emergency c section beautifully and I have almost no visible scarring.

However. He was ver patronizing at my last OB appt and a bit patronizing during the previous two I had with him. My biggest bome to pick however is how he treated me the day in had (and almost lost) my twins. He treated me and my family horribly, was mean and made everything nice and panicky/scary for me, allowed his nursing team to throw my family's belief in God in their faces during a time of crisis, left the babies in me for THREE hours after KNOWING baby A was in clear distress (which resulted in baby A being born 'technically ' dead and he ended up with HIE and now may have cerebral palsy) and because he needed resuscitated, my other baby was put to the side and he ended up with cardiac arrest. And HIE because he coded too.  He could have prevented all of that or at least treated us with decency, but he didnt.",Male
"10/22/2018 - I went to Dr. Aamodt for my annual biopsy. I value the care I get from Dr. Aamodt to the utmost. He is an incredibly knowledgeable doctor with sensitivity, total respect and awesome care. I have never had a bad experience with Dr. Aamodt even through all my issues. Dr. Aamodt exudes excellence in all areas. I highly recommend him to anyone. If you are looking for care that is second to none call 540-438-1314 and experience the awesome care for yourself.",Male
"It's such a relief to find a physician who is kind and compassionate as well as supremely competent. Dr. Aamoth is such a nice man! And it's clear that his years of practice have left him with a creative range of treatment tools that I would never expect to find in a younger doctor trained in the practice model of 30 perfunctory seconds per patient. Dr. Aamoth listens, cares, and smiles -- what a concept!! He's a treasure.",Male
"Always leave feeling that I was in very good hands, caring attention from everyone involved.  All questions answered until I felt comfortable and completely informed  as to what was being done and results that may or would occur during treatment.",Male
This was the first  time going to this clinic  and Dr. He was very sincere and patient. I really felt in competent  hands with Dr Aanderud. His staff is very good and professional  as well. Highly recommend. ,Male
"Saw Dr. Aanderud in October 2016 for a subaceous cyst on my nose.  He did not explain much to me because he had several college students observing him that day and I wasn't asked if it was okay for them to be in the room.  He told me the cyst was caused from smoking cigarettes.  He then injected the cyst on my nose with Kenalog Acetonide 10mg but after a year, the bump has grown larger.  Told my regular doc about this visit with Aanderud and he was apalled.",Male
This Doctor was friendly and knowledgeable . Listen to everything I had to say and made me feel comfortable.,Male
"The office tried to force my 90 year old senile mother into MOHS surgery, making us feel like we were withholding life saving treatment.  I expressed my concerns via fax as well as hand delivering a copy of the letter to the office.  No one EVER contacted us regarding our complaint that a person in that office was trying to guilt us into treatment.   I had heard good things about this practice, its too bad one apple can spoil the entire barrel but the fact that our concerns were ignored...sad!",Male
"Phenomenal Dr with less invasive incisions from my experience. I knew others who had similar surgery, but different dr and I was impressed with how small &amp; precise my scars were compared to others and that alone was impressive. Highly recommend. Caring, informative, precise with knowledgeable expertise. I requested this dr for a separate issue years later for different issue due to the fact I trust him, his skills &amp; knowledge.",Male
"Spent A LOT of time answering my questions, explaining the surgical procedure I will be having. Never seemed to be rushed. Very compassionate toward my concerns and fear of having major surgery for the first time. Has definitely built up my trust in him. ",Male
I enjoy having her as my provider. She is honest and has very good bed side manner. I have recommended her to others and they have had the same experience.,Female
"Dr. Aanestad is knowledgeable, up to date, and cooperative. It is a team effort between patient and doctor, not the typical doctors way or the highway. She is also patient and kind, a great listener. ",Female
"Dr. Aanestad takes her time in the visits with you,  o rush, explains everything in detail,answers all questions. Doesn't make you make an appointment for each individual situation. She actually looks like she practices what she preaches.  She is. Not a quick fix Doctor she is for long term, she keeps you up to date on your physicals, your exams, bloodwork etc.. Very friendly. I'm sorry to hear the bad review because in my book she gets an A+ and I would highly recommend. Not condensending at al",Female
"Dr Aanestad is rude, condescending, didn't allow me to be part of my care. Doesn't listen, dictates her agenda. Missed a life threatening condition, which is when I had enough. I would not send anyone to her. ",Female
She is a wonderful doctor and she takes care of me and my husband like a family member.,Female
"Excellent doctor. I've been seeing her for 25 years and she is highly knowledgeabl. She also has taken care of my Dad and my Mom. 

Love her wouldn't go to anyone else!!!!!!",Female
"Have been going here for years. Dr. Aanosen is a wonderful doctor and person. She is intelligent, compassionate, kind, and tries to get to know her patients on a personal level. Highly recommended!",Female
Dr. Aarabi found my back issue right away.  Surgery was quick. Healing was fast.,Male
"I've never written a bad review about a doctor before, nor have I ever walked out of a doctor's office. Congratulations to Dr. Aaronson, you're the first! He comes off as extremely arrogant and unwilling to listen to his patients. Run away from this guy as fast as you can.",Male
"Not good. I found him cold, off-putting and crass.  He seemed a bit concerned about my ability to pay. I use Medicare and a United Healthcare Supplement. which is highly rated.  I found that really crass, add to that his attitude towards me --- no more visits with him!!!",Male
"Dr Aaranson did surgery to correct a bunion on my foot.  It resulted in metatarsalgia, which can happen.  Dr Aaranson did not either know this was a side effect of bunion surgery or was not willing to admit this to me.  I ended up going to three other doctors to confirm that was the case and eventually resolved the issue with an orthodic.  All of that could have been avoided if Dr Aaranson had known how to resolve the issue.",Male
"The night of my surgery I found that my bandaging was pretty well soaked with blood. After trying to contact someone from Dr Aaronson's office for a couple hours, my husband insisted on going to the hospital. When I came to my appointment a few days later,  he laughed when he came in the door and said""gush, you're bleeding everywhere"".  I didn't find this amusing. He seems to think he is funny but it comes across as cruel and unprofessional.   His nurse,  Abby, is a very sweet person.  I don't know how she can stand working for such an unkind man.",Male
saw him based on above review...totally agree!! This guy was great! Very knowligable and caring. Would definatly recommend!,Male
Dr. Aaronson was great! He listened to my problems and gave me a great option for treatments. He has a great personality and is really funny. He made my pain go away completely.,Male
"Critt is hands down the best doctor I have ever encountered. Patient, caring and actually listens to his patient’s.  I’m never leaving his care, been through many medical things from Crohn’s to cancer.  He is worth the wait and is very busy.",Male
"""Practice Closed""...
I called Tanner Clinic in July 2019 to schedule with Critt Aardema. They told me the soonest he would see new patients was September 9th. I was a little hesitant to schedule so I thought about it for a couple weeks. On the one hand- this guy must be pretty good if he's so booked up... On the other hand would it suck to try and get into see him when I really need something?!? A couple weeks later I walked into the clinic- I decided he's probably worth the wait. The receptionist informed me his practice is ""Closed"" to new patients. That is so Bizarre to me. Seeing so many patients come and go for various reasons (move out of the area /  bad experiences with Clinic staff / death?!?) Wouldn't it be good business practice to establish a waiting list instead of ""[closing] the practice to new patients"" 5 stars for the doc and his current patients. 1 star for administrative/support staff because new patients will never see him ""closed practice""",Male
"My husband and I have been under the care of Dr. Aardema for the last 3 years since we moved to Utah. We feel very blessed to have found such a knowledgable, skilled, personable and compassionate family physician. We feel he saved my husband's life by encouraging him to do a ColoGuard test which eventually led to colon surgery for cancer.  He is now cancer free.",Male
Critt is the best doctor I've had in 40 years- he's kind and compassionate- he truly cares about his patients.   He is also extremely sharp-  I read that he is one of the best doctors to ever come through the University of Utah's school of medicine...and I believe it!,Male
Dr. Aardema is incredible!  He makes me feel comfortable from the moment I walk in.  If I'm not needing to be on the table I'll sit on the chairs next to him.  He LISTENS AND CARES! He brought up things that I had been embarrassed to talk about but he assured me that it's nothing to be embarrassed about:) He is very thorough and doesn't make me feel rushed. He also only has me come in when needed unlike others I've seen before.  He's is wonderful with ALL AGES from my teenagers to my parents!!!!,Male
Dr. Aardema has been the only Doctor that I have had that has ever seemed to care about my health and the only one who stuck with me until we got diagnosis to help me out. I have been to several states now because my husband was in the military and so I have had a lot of Doctors. Dr. Aardema will always be my favorite! He give empathy and that's something that makes such a great Doctor! ,Male

There's no better doctor in my opinion.",Female
"Dr. Aaron is highly competent and listens to my questions. She gives detailed and accurate responses to these questions and puts my mind at ease.

"I had 3 partially torn tendons in right shoulder and right bicep. my  PCP  recommended I visit DR. Daniel Aaron for an analysis. 
He concluded that surgery was called for since the pain from the 3 tears had become  unexceptionable. Now 4 months after surgery my right arm is just about perfect. Dr Daniel Aaron and his team did a wonderful job.",Male
"I visited Dr. Aaron due to a shoulder injury, likely torn rotator cuff. He examined my shoulder, and after a thorough analysis, performed surgery as I was in pain every night with the injury. The surgery was a better outcome than I could have ever expected. Cleaned up the injury, repaired a torn bicep, and took care of the persistent bursitis as well. I was recommended to Dr Aaron by a orthopaedic surgeon who went to school with him, as I was looking for a specialist in shoulder surgery, and very happy that I chose Dr. Aaron.",Male

I experienced no pain when I was in the hospital due to Dr. Aaron’s proactive approach to pain management, and I had no pain whatsoever when I went home and did not require any pain medications whatsoever, not even an aspirin. The whole experience was and continues to be nothing short of amazing considering I had full shoulder replacement surgery.  I am 17 days post surgery and I feel amazing.",Male
"I saw Dr. Aaron as the hospitalist OBGYN at Northside Hospital-Forsyth. After several months of planning for a VBAC, I went past 41 weeks and was scheduled for a repeat cesarean. Dr. Aaron turned out to be a godsend, because the morning I checked in for surgery, she let me know that she was willing to try a gentle induction. She supported me through 15 hours of labor and helped me achieve the VBAC I wanted. I felt extremely comfortable and safe in her care.",Female
"horrible new side manner, didn't really answer  any questions in regards to my condition or concerns for my pregnancy complications.",Female
"I don't ever do this but I was very disappointed.  I was first appointment of the day 7AM.  was sitting in office with just a johnnie for at least 20 minutes. Saw her as I was going in office her and two other people were chatting it up outside the office.  She comes in and hardly looks at me just says you don't need to come back.  Gives a recommendation for eye lid surgery which is not paid for by insurance.  I was embarrassed and disappointed.

"I waited 5 months to write this, so my head is as clear as possible. As much as I initially liked Dr Aaron, I have no respect for a doctor or doctor’s office that will not listen to their patients’ wishes.
I just moved to the area and made an appointment with her office because she was in-network, and 2 blocks away! Score!!! I specified over the phone before it was made that I only wanted preventative annual tests according to the healthcare reform guidelines. All hospitals have access to this list. I even got a list of services from my insurance and made sure to repeat myself during the appointment. 
Guess who’s now stuck with a bill for tests the insurance company deemed uncoverable because they were not a part of the healthcare reform guidelines?! 
 have left several request for someone to reach out, and I’m still waiting. Shocker!",Female
Did not listen to questions being asked so did not answer any questions I had.  Stated at follow up visit he did not remember looking at my son's ultrasound of his neck when he had looked at it at the initial visit for a benign 2mm mass on his neck.,Male
"She is the best ! Very professional and very smart ...she save my baby in my delivery day
Thank you very much doctor!!",Female
"I found what other 1-star reviewers said very true. Dr. Aaron's bedside manner is very belittling, and she and her staff would rush you through your whole appointment. I saw Dr. Aaron twice only because of the schedule. To do an ultrasound, I was told to pay off the full amount at her office, and a few months later her office called me and emailed me accusing me that I owed them money for the ultrasound. What kind of bullsh*t is this. Never going back.",Female
"Dr. Aaron recently delivered our wonderful, healthy 3 month old baby boy! From the moment we met Dr. Aaron, we were impressed by her professionalism, knowledge and efficiency. Most importantly, she has such a calm and reassuring demeanor. Dr. Aaron had a special way of easing all worries and concerns! Dr. Aaron was incredibly skillful and decisive and we were at peace with every decision she helped us make. We highly recommend Dr. Aaron and can't wait for her to help us with baby #2!",Female
Dr. Aaron delivered my baby as she was “on call” at the time I went into labor.  It was a terrifying unprofessional experience.  Dr. A did not take my well being into account as this was my first child. I struggled with ptsd as a result of my experience with her.  I would never reccomend her services.,Female
"The worst possible doctor I can imagine.  Horrible bedside manner!  Clearly does not care about the patient, completely careless, walks into the room almost always confusing you with a different patient, earning money is clearly a  priority over providing care, wait time has never been less than 45 minutes.  I would highly recommend staying away from this doctor!",Female
"I was sitting in the exam chair only partially dressed when Dr Aaron recommended an ultrasound. She asked her front desk staff if my insurance covered it and assured me that I was indeed fully covered. A few months later, in the same position, I had two more ultrasounds.

As it turns out, I was not fully covered. When I called the office to find out what happened, Dr Aaron saw in my file that she had indeed told me I was fully covered but blamed me for not understanding my coverage. How could I ",Female
Let me start by saying Dr. Aaron is brilliant. I was pregnant with my 3rd child at the age of 41. I had high blood pressure and was at risk for complications. Dr. Aaron provided excellent care and even ordered some tests others thought were overly cautious. Thank God she did. She saved my baby's life! Her skill is unparalleled and I am deeply grateful. I knew she was an excellent GYN for years having taken care of me but it wasn't until she became my OB that I realized just how excellent she rea,Female

A very caring doctor with an excellent bedside manner. Extremely thorough and approachable.,Male
"I chose Dr. Aaron to do my colonoscopy on the recommendation of a couple of folks at my primary care physician's office.  I found him to be personable, attentive, conscientious, &amp; professional.  He saw something odd on the colonoscopy he wanted to follow up.  Turns out I had a benign tumor on my appendix (he did an appendectomy a couple weeks later).  A less conscientious doctor might have said the colon was clean and been done with it, but Dr. Aaron went the extra step &amp; I'm very glad he did!",Male
"My experience with Dr. Aaron was less than ideal.  I waited 4 hours in the waiting room past my appointment time before I was able to see him.  When I was finally escorted into the examination room, Dr. Aaron's ""bed side manner"" was non-existent, no greeting, no acknowledgement of my presence at all.  I have changed to another doctor for my health needs.",Male
"I waited as a new patient to see Dr. Aaron for 2.5 hours in the waiting room, once I finally got back to see him he was in with me for less than 5 minutes and never looked up from his computer once at me. Didn’t touch me at all to listen to my heart/lungs or anything. Worst doctor I’ve ever seen, and then he had no problem sending me as astronomical bill for what my insurance wouldn’t cover because he over charges.",Male
"I did a sleep study at Dr Aaron's Elkton Office.    I tried on 4-masks in preparation of using the CPAP machine. I selected 2-masks to potentially use for the study, that remained in the room.  The 2-masks not selected were placed back in the boxes they came out of and the lids were closed up.  After briefly sleeping, I woke up because of the heat, I couldn't sleep because I was sweating, room was 80+ degrees and I had to wait over 30-minutes for the technician.  I was tossing &amp; turning, the bed was hard &amp; hurt my hips.  Then I started wondering about the cleanliness of the masks I chose to potentially wear.  I did finally fall asleep for a few hours.  After the technician removed the wires, he left taking the masks that were in the room with him.  I have no idea what was done with the masks that had remained with me.  I can't bring myself to go back to complete the study with the CPAP machine for fear of contracting something.   If I could i would give Dr. Aaron a negative rating.",Male

"Never on time. My wife is currently there in the waiting room still unseen. Her appointment was for 530pm. 

I experienced the same issue when I went to Dr Aaron for my sleep study years ago. 

Rather than give you a take home sleep study, his office forces patients to spend the night multiple times before getting hardware to take home for a sleep study.",Male

"Dr. Aaron is arrogant while trying to be calm and helpful. He does NOT listen to the patient and gives outrageous responses to questions. I believe that if I didn't pursue the issue with another doctor, that my husband would get much worse.  If I could give him a zero star, I would.",Male
"Unprofessional. At first visit had a nonprofessional give me a test to evaluate if I required oxygen. Dr. Aaron did not listen I was recovering from walking pneumonia and prescribed JUST on this test.  Really?  Oxygen for 24/7.
Had his head buried in his laptop and minimal eye contact. Unprofessional.
Follow up visit in PA office with ceiling tiles with mold!  Made to wait 2 1/2 hours!!  
Found no evidence of any reason suggested a lung biopsy. Of course I didn’t follow up w that advise.
Found a professional Pulmonologist!  DO NOT RECOMMEND!",Male
"Difficulty reaching anyone to schedule an appointment. Busy signal for extended periods of time (30 min lunch period) over several days. Response once finally reached- I was told mornings only and when I asked to clarify, she repeated mornings only but no range of times until I specifically asked ""from what time until what time please"". Long wait once in the office. Prescription not ready because never called in and then wrong dose from what discussed.",Male
Unbelievably Unprofessional. Should have his license revoked. Each visit I have to wait over an hour for him to show up. He is rushed and unkind. Sorry I wasted my money there. ,Male
Wait times are horrible and he's always over booked.,Male
"Most unprofessional physician I’ve ever met. Walks into the room, looks at his computer, doesn’t look at me, and starts asking questions. I didn’t know who he was. 

Crowds his office with patients by scheduling more than he can see in the allotted time. 

Got a sleep study but no one called with results. Someone called wanting to send a CPAP to my house. No training or explanation why I need it. ",Male
"All the other reviews are accurate. Not a pleasant experience. My case is straightforward and he is in-network and fairly close, otherwise I would have gone to someone, anyone, else. His overnight sleep-study nurse in Elkton is really good, however. She is efficient and friendly.",Male
"I had a consultation and I left feeling like I was a inconvenience.  He asked me what I was ""complaining"" about to warrant a consultation. When explaining the next steps he talked a mile a minute. If I have a choice I will not return.",Male
"I saw Dr Aaron since 1999.  When I first saw him, he was very thorough.  However, the last time I saw him (2016), all he did was listen to my chest.  He sat at his desk and just reviewed his records on a laptop.  I'm not going back.",Male
"Thanks Dr. Aaron for getting me in to see u quickly when my CPAP machine broke and for getting my prescription faxed out in a timely matter. I have severe sleep apnea and rely heavily on my CPAP machine and use it every night. Dr. Aaron spent as much time with me as was needed to update my files, yes, he asked a lot of questions and spent a good bit of time entering the info on his laptop but that's what he needs to do to be thorough, considering the fact that I haven't seen him  for a few yrs.",Male
"Had a consolation with this doctor recently. i was waiting forever, then they moved me into three rooms like musical chairs until i went into his office. Too many people waiting. He never once looked up to see my face. I was with my son and this Dr. thought he was my husband as he never tried to look at us. He had over 100 symptom questions that he was reading from his computer. I asked him to slow down but he said he has to get through them. He was hiding in front of his monitor the entire time",Male
"I have evidence that this office double books and even triple books same times. How can three people waiting in the packed waiting area have exact same appointment times for a single Doctor?  Dr. Aaron will not take the time to explain condition in detail. Treats me as if don't have the mental capacity to understand my condition.  I have put up with the BS for too long, time to find a professional that actually cares about treating patients and not just over booking office visits. ",Male
"Awful experience, left the doctors office crying.",Male
Dr. Aaron did nothing about the high pressure in my right eye. She did not have a visual field test performed to determine if any damage was occurring in that eye due to the pressure. Fortunately I changed to a different ophthalmologist this year who did perform that test. It was found that I had glaucoma with significant damage already done to the eye. I would not advise anyone to use her as their doctor.,Female
"The most professional, compassionate, and down-to-earth Dr. you will ever have the privilege of meeting. She has performed surgery/cataract implant/surgery, and also treats me for Macular Degeneration.  Her expertise is A Plus and her manner is peaceful. I feared having eye surgery because I have degrees of claustrophobia; none with her. She listens/ and allows patient/to express any concerns, or ask any questions/about procedures. I recommend her highly.",Female
EXCELLENT!,Female
"Dr. Aaron saved my life. Literally. I was 47years old, an undiagnosed diabetic who had a seizure and then a heart attack, all on the way to the hospital, where I then had a very large stroke. My ejection fraction was about 20%. Thanks to the amazing care I received from Dr. Aaron, in 6 weeks my EF was up to over 30%, heading towards 35%. I have great hopes it will keep trending up from here. Dr. Aaron is not only patient and kind when dealing with you, he is also gentle and non-judgmental, which is often needed when you are dealing with such an overwhelming amount of medical information. He took the time to talk TO me, not AT me, and to answer my multitude of questions. I would highly recommend him for any of your heart failure needs. He is absolutely excellent.",Male
Dr. Mark Aaron has been my heart failure doctor for the past twelve years.  When I first saw him I could barely walk eight feet and would be out of breath and have to sit down.  My injection fraction was 27 and now it has stayed at 45 consistently.  We moved to florida two years ago and I drive back to Nashville to see him.   I highly recommend him and know he has saved my life.,Male
I’ve been a patient for almost 19 years. Excellent doctor who always listen and we fix any problems I have medication wise.,Male
"I first saw Dr. Aaron in 1986 and was relieved by his diagnosis. I again had cause to see him in about 2008 and have been seeing him periodically ever since. He is cautious but not overly so, he takes his time and does all the necessary tests and gives great advice that allowed me to continue doing the things I enjoy doing. He has also seen me when I had A-fib attacks right away without an appointment. His staff and facilities are 21st century for sure.",Male
"Best I have ever had, and I have had some good ones.  Open, honest, knowledgeable.  Dr. Aaron cares about his patients and seems to be better at diagnosing problems than the specialists!!!!  I hope he does not retire before I pass.   ",Male
"Doctor Aaron is always pleasant, listens and takes the time to answer questions and explains everything. Has excellent diagnostic skills and reviews test results thoroughly.",Male
"My husband saw Dr Aaron for a fractured clavicle (displaced) at Scripps ER. He was discharged without an ortho referral and no pain medication. He was told to follow up with his primary care in a week, and told him he could get a second opinion but his medical opinion was that it would heal fine as-is. No Ortho consult in the ER. I wish I could attach an image of the x-ray to share how bad the fracture is. Dr Aaron's demeanor and attention was fine, hence the three stars.",Male
"Dr. Aaron helped out my 32 year old son, after being admitted into Scripps Encinitas Emergency for a complex migraine. He was very helpful, friendly and listened to all of our concerns. He ordered a CT scan for his neck, to check for any blockage of the arteries and found none. My son was released with a prescription for any further migraines.",Male
"Dr. Aaron has been our children?s doctor since 1997. Through every age, stage, and issue, Dr. Aaron has helped us through with sound advice. His energetic personality and humor make him well suited for pediatrics.",Male

"Karen from dr Aaron's office called to schedule my appointment.  After explaining why my colonoscopy had to be done at the hospital, she went ahead and made it for his other location.  I questioned her because she made it clear that it had to be done at the hospital.  She spoke to me like I was the slow kid.  I put in for the time off at work.  Twelve days later I received a call telling me the appointment had to be rescheduled because it had to be done at the hospital.  Incompetent staff!",Male
"Not prepared at initial visit or second visit.  Records had been sent well in advance and Dr. Aaron had not even looked to see if there were any before I brought my mother there.  I came in for the second appointment, giving the benefit of the doubt about an initial bad first impression, but she was once again rude and dismissive and still had not looked at the records that I told her were there for her to look over at the last visit about 4 weeks before. Both visits, ""why are you here?""",Female
"Don't bother unless you want to be completely ignored.  My appointment with  her was a joke. When someone asks you a question, and the answer is ignored,  that means you have a lazy  Dr.",Female
She is very rude to other healthcare professionals. She does not have respect for other people's time. Everyone in the healthcare should work together not against each other to make sure that every patient gets the best attention. She is not professional in that sense. She is not willing to work with professionals. ,Female
"Dr. Aaron has more knowledge and information than any doctor I've encountered, and he is able to integrate so many issues and arrive at, and help me understand, the issue at hand in its context.  His office staff is wonderful.

"Dr. Aaron was very understanding and helpful.  He helped me find an alternative to knee replacement that has thus far worked great for me.  He listened attentively to my concerns and was able to answer my questions.
",Male
Dr. Aaron was short tempered as if I were keeping him from a special event. I had never had an EMG and the procedure was only half explained as he did the procedure. Extremely painful with needles been inserted and telling me it has to reach the muscle in left thigh and back. ,Male
Dr. Aaron cares so much for his patients and really takes the time to answer questions and tailors each treatment to meet individual needs. The best in town hands-down. I would take anyone in my family to see him without hesitation.,Male

My child was diagnosed with peanut allergies and my other child will start immunotherapy for her sever tree pollen allergies.  We are all allergic to different substances, which makes avoiding them hard.  Dr. Aarons carefully diagnosed each of us and kept close monitoring of our illness.",Male
"I was very sick when I went to see her.  She was extremely thorough and a good listener.  On my behalf, she called another physician for me who is a specialist and spoke with him.  She made up a plan that covered all of my symptoms and called me with lab results. Within just a few days I was much better.  I so appreciated her personal touch and the feeling of old fashioned medicine when the doctor took as much time as needed to resolve complex issues.",Female
"Empathetic, thourough, &amp; personable. Best experience I’ve had with any doctor. ",Female
"We recently became full-timers to the area and thrilled to establish our primary care w Dr. Aarons.  My husband and I had our first appts last week—she is OUTSTANDING!!

"I had surgery this past summer 2018 by Dr. Aarons and found him to be a wonderful, caring surgeon - can't say enough positive things about him! However, because he is at HUP he has no say over what staff gets assigned to him and this is a problem. The worst Physician Assistant I ever met works for him (think self-absorbed, immature, inept Millenial) and I found one of his residents to be horrible (again, another idiot Millenial). I won't go back to his practice again if I have to deal with them",Male
Dr. Aarons is a great surgeon with a calming and confident bedside manner. He got me through two major abdominal surgeries and I highly recommend him.,Male
He is wonderful!,Male
"Dr. Aarons and his staff have been great to work with.  The office was quick to provide an appointment for my son after he injured his wrist in a sporting event.

Thank you Dr. Aarons and team! ",Male
"Dr. Aarons is a very knowledgeable, professional and respectful Orthopedic Specialist/Surgeon. He has seen and been absolutely great with our 5 yr. old son since he was 1 yr. old.

"Personable, engaged with a great bedside manner!  Spends time focused on you and your problem.  Superb gastroenterologist!",Male
I called to reschedule an appointment but the lady on the line (Dina) was rude. People who works on healthcare MUST have a heart no matter what they are going through. To think that this will be mg first time to meet the doctor. ,Male
"Was referred to see this doctor from my primary. Set a appointment for a month out. Went to the appt, they checked me in a room, waited 20mins before he came in just to tell me that he can’t see me and to see my old GI, which he moved 55 miles away. He was extremely rude and moody towards me. I dont know if he was having a bad day or what but as medical professional you do not take your personal issues out on patients period. Avoid him, you’ve been warned!",Male
Dr Aaron's diagnosed my mother with IBS a couple of years ago. She recently went back into his office with severe abdominal pain and asked if he thought there was something else going on. Without doing any additional procedures like a scope or ordering a colonoscopy he told her it was just her IBS and to come back in a few weeks. A week later she was in the hospital because of a bowel obstruction. Do not go to this man. He needs to retire. ,Male
" Well i was kind of disappointed at first it took me two months to see him ,  but it was well worth it !! He spent a lot of time with me explaining what my stomach issues were and how to best minimize flareups from coming back. Didn't feel rushed at all to get out,spent a lot of time with me and educated me on what my body was going through. Thanks Dr. Aarons really appreciated your time today! Helped me a lot knowing that I'm going to be OK!  Would recommend him to any of  my family or friends!",Male
He's a great doctor that takes time to listen to his patient. My general practice doctor told me Dr Aaron's is the best there is. He did a colonoscopy &amp; put a scope down my stomach.

"Since 2019 I have received a number of epidurals and other similar procedures from Dr. Aarons. On each occasion him and his staff have been top of the line professional overall in every aspect. Receiving the treatment each time was not something that I was overly concerned because I trust him. He has educated me on what works to treat my lower back pain, and he has been on point each and every time. The last treatment I received seemed to knock out a lot of the pain and stiffness effectively, unfortunately with the type of lower back injury I have my pain most of the time reoccurs after a period of time, short of surgery. I would definitely recommend Dr. Aarons for anyone who is suffering a similar physical situation.",Male
I am due for surgery tomorrow. I cannot walk and in pain that leaves me breathless and screaming from. Saw Dr. Aarons and had injections. I have tried to get my records for my visit for my surgery tomorrow and his office has given me the runaround. I would not recommend at all.,Male

"Dr. Aarons has been my doctor for many years and I was always satisfied with his work. I get epidural injections in my neck but up until today, I was always sedated. I had one bad experience with an injection without sedation from another doctor because Dr. Aarons was not available that day. Today I went for my epidural injection, without sedation, done by Dr. Aarons and I cannot believe the difference. Dr. Aarons talked me thru the whole procedure and as I was bracing for the pain, he simply said, ok we are all done!!!! There was little to no pain and I'm more than satisfied with my experience.

"I have been going to Dr Aaron’s for several years. I also went to other Doctors because my insurance would not permit me to go to Dr. Aaron’s. Each time I went to Dr. Aarons I was completely  without pain in my lower back. With other doctors  that I went to, I  only felt slightly better and for a month or two at best. His experience and know how is second to none. He also helped my wife who had 5 buldged discs with a series of injections and has been pain free for about 4 years now, thanks to Dr. Aaron’s. Also his nurse Darryl is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in every way. They’re a fantastic team!",Male
"My husband has been in excruciating pain for 9 months and after seeing many kinds of specialized doctors and having endless tests I had to do my own research as to his problem.  Not many doctors have heard of ACNES but when I Googled it, Dr. Aarons name popped up and so I emailed him with my husband’s problem, and he responded to me immediately.  Fortunately, we live in Florida where he is located and made an appointment.

Dr. Aarons patiently listened to every detail and spent a considerable amount of time with us.  He totally understands and is very professional.  We have been under his care with 2 tap blocks.  We have seen some improvement as of this writing, but it will take time to know for sure if the problem has been cured.

"Dr Aaronson is nice and professional. His office is nice, clean, but small. However, my mother is diabetic and Dr trimmed her  toenails with the equipment. My mother said it was painful and bled.

I told the worker but she insisted. Then another time, worker would not
Let me and my son go in the room with my mother.",Male
I would NOT recommend this doctor to any of my friends or family. He did a bunionectomy on my large left toe and it healed with the toe too high.

She INSISTED Fri. night 6-29-18 that my 88 year old mother did not have a UTI, refused her medical admittance to the hospital and wanted her committed to a geri psych unit.  Salem Hospital (NSMC) kept her 3 days in the ED.  Her psych symptoms cleared up late Sunday.  She had a seizure, was finally admitted. It was determined she had not had a stroke but had a UTI all along.  She was finally treated with antibiotics, returned to her normal routine in one week.",Female
Dr. Aaronson is wonderful. Down to earth and professional. I am lucky to have found him through my Primary Doctor! Great team! He is the person you want to see! Trust me!,Male
"I had visited Dr. Aaronson for a second opinion for heart transplant. I made it very clear that I wanted him to review my medical records  to see if he came to the same diagnosis and medical recommendations as my current advanced heart disease specialist.  Dr. Aaronson glanced over progress notes from my current advanced heart disease specialist.  He then copied and pasted her information and findings into his own progress note without making any medical decisions himself.  He failed to review my cardiac test results, lab work, scans, heart cath, etc.  He ordered blood work and an EKG which were performed on the same day as my office visit  and never provided me with any results.  50 minutes into the appointment, he began looking at his watch and announced he had other pts to see.  21  days following my appointment he finally dictated a progress note.  I have a life threatening condition and sought the ""expert"" advice of Dr. Aaronson and was vastly disappointed.",Male
"In all my 73 years I have never found a more caring doctor.
He listens to what you have to say and I have  the utmost confidence in him.",Male
"Dr Neil has been my ENT specialist since I was a toddler.  I am 48 now.  All of my children have been his patients as well, until I moved out of state.  He, along with his great staff literally saved my hearing and my singing voice. He has always been a phone call away and was more than a doctor, he was like a good friend.  I highly reccommend his office",Male
"I would recommend Dr. Aaronson to everyone I know with spinal issues, he is an amazing surgeon, he has done both of my back sugeries, is always ready and willing to listen to my issues and find the root cause of what is going on. If you ask me I would give him 100+ stars if I could",Male
"He did not seem interested..My MRI read that i had disc bulge , spinal stenosis and sciatica and he referred me to a rheumatologist..i diodnt get two words in edge wise..He could have cared less...i see he was highly reccomended and thats why i consulted with him..i am from Kentucky He was from Tennesse. I left confused and felt ignored..",Male
"June 2018 surgery. Pain level was a 9 before his surgery. Year later still at a level zero. Before surgery, life wasn’t worth living because of back pain. Now pain is still gone because of Dr. Aaronson",Male
"Dr. Aaronson performed spinal surgery on me in early 2018. I was experiencing constant pain in my upper legs. He told me it could take up to a year or longer to feel relief. In June 2019 - 18 months after the surgery - my pain abated and I am now pain free!
I so appreciate Dr. Aaronson’s expertise. He has given me a pain free life!",Male
"I saw Dr. Aaronson in 2014 after a very large tumor was discovered in my spinal canal. I researched myself best doctors for this surgery and came across him. I knew from my first appointment that this was the doctor I wanted. He is so knowledgeable and very professional, yet also very caring. My surgery was a very difficult one and I have no doubt he remembers it well as it was around ten hours long and a difficult tumor to completely remove. I had a very difficult recovery but I’m convinced Dr. Aaronson was the absolutely best doctor to help me. He’s still my favorite doctor out of the many I have dealt with. I would not hesitate to use him again should I need another tumor removed. Other doctors could learn a lot from him as far as treating patients with respect and kindness. Highly recommend!",Male
"The front reception area was nice and the staff were very friendly to me. I have only saw Dr. Aaronson 2 times for my neck issues. He is not very personable or chatty, but he is very skilled and comes highly recommended. He does recommend other treatments before surgery and I appreciate that. He is very knowledgeable and seems very professional, which is the most important when it comes down to it.",Male
I had to go in  Dr. Aaronson office on 3-12-2018 because I had fallen hard and wanted to make sure I did not damage my back where he done my back surgery. I did not seen the Doctor but a nurse. I want to let you know everyone of his workers had a big smile on their faces. Makes you feel better when you see smiling faces.Thanks to all of you for making me feel good.    Mary Price,Male
"Very knowledgeable, has a great reputation from other patients. He is very polite and a man of few words. Only small criticism is the he does seem to be ""on to the next patient"" pretty quickly.  Front desk staff at Howell Allen Clinic are not very ""patient oriented"". To be fair, they are not rude or unkind, but clearly not compassionate or courteous to patients in the waiting area.",Male
I first saw Dr. Aaronson 3 years ago. He had me try pain management first. Eventually I had to have surgery. I knew I wanted Dr. Aaronson to perform the surgery. It was extensive. I am so happy to have found him. I feel he was God sent. My wife an I think he is a wonder caring doctor. We would certainly recommend him.  He takes time to it listen to you. Thank you Dr. Aaronson an your staff. You all are the best.,Male
dr aaronson has been treating me for 10 years he is the only dr i trust,Male
"Highly qualified given his years of experience. Excellent listener, provides the rationale for his recommendations. Engages with you on a personal level and is concerned if your wait was too long or there were any system issues with his office. Was voted 'Most Compassionate Physician"" by Vanderbilt nurses and that has also been our experience with him. He rearranged his entire surgery schedule to attend to my husband who was in pain with a herniated disc. He is a nurses doctor..really great guy.",Male
"After consulting with 2 other neurosurgeons during which I felt like a cattle call for patients that need spinal surgery, I came away feeling as though Dr. Aaronson listened, explained and wants to provide the best, most appropriate care for my situation.  I would recommend Dr. Parkinson without hesitation to anyone.  Ditto for his staff.

A very knowledgeable and helpful physician AND staff.  The best of the best.",Male
"I suffered from back and leg pain for 6 years.  After my surgery, I was up walking within 4 hours and discharged from the hospital within 2 days. My pain has completely resolved and I feel like Dr Aaronson gave me my life back! Would readily recommend him!!!!!",Male

Didn’t find my cancer till it was too late. Became stage IV and lost a few organs.,Male
"Dr. Aaronson operated on me and oerforated my bladder. I understand that this could be a side effect with this procedure, but his total lack of treatment afterwards was unbelievable. I went back to him 2 or 3 times. My insides were burning from the chemo that seeped out of the bladder and he never admitted to perhaps oerforating me. I went to another urologist and needed a follow-up surgery. Fat had seeped out of my bladder and need to be removed. What should have been an uneventful procedure initially turned into a 5 month nightmare. I would NOT RECCOMEND Dr. Aaronson fir anything.",Male
"I feel very lucky to have Dr. Aaronson to take care of my uncle, who was sick and needed an operation. Dr. Aaronson is very prefessional and has such compassion toward his patients. He performed an operation on my uncle, and went to the hospital to check him out 2 times even it was weekend, and Dr. Aaronson was not on duty.  Dr. Aaronson  patiently talked with me and my family to expain what was going on and what we needed to do.Now my uncle is in recovering. and we want Thank You toDr. Aaronson",Male
"Dr. Aaronson can be a real jerk, if it wasn't for his staff and the convenient location, my first visit should have been my only visit.   He doesn't do lots of testing and procedures, he is not willing to investigate any further to find solutions.  No compassion for pain, none whatsoever.  I feel for the elderly patients who  visit him.   No one wants to be told to come back next week and be told to just drink more water, when you are in pain.  He is good for a one time UTI, nothing else.",Male
"I just met Dr. Aaronson and i was seen within a few minutes of my appointment tine.  He was very kind, caring and took the time to explain everything and i cant thank him enough.",Male
"Excellent Doctor , and very good staff ",Male
"Hi, My visit to your Clinic was excellent. I was more than happy to meet Dr. Binder, as he’s an excellent profissional eye specialist and frankly speaking I’m considering him as sincere friend and brother in addition to his expertise.",Male
Horrible visit. Rude. Sarcastic. Staff was the same.,Male
"I visited this dr. today at the Acuity-Retina Institute  and found him to be extremely condescending, rude and with no manners!  And he even asked me if I brought someone with me as if I couldn't absorb information he gave me!  I was totally taken aback by this doctor and I will not visit with him again or will I ever recommend him.",Male
Felt like he didn't know what he was doing and condescending to women. He told me to bring a man in so he could explain things to him as if I wouldn't understand. He then explained things as if I were a five year old (very condescending). Office is over crowded and an appointment that should take 20 minutes take 2.5 hours (even if you show up early) due to over scheduling. Front desk is rude and unhelpful and blames Obama for everything (including their over scheduling) which may be true.,Male
always excellent.  thorough and knowledgeable and professional.,Male

I am a retired Internist who recently moved from NJ to Colorado and see  Dr. Brad Baack for my dermatologic care. He diagnosed an early melanoma and basal cell on my first visit.

He is among the best Dermatologists I have been associated with.,Male
Dr. was caring and kind.,Male
I had some concerns regarding some spots that looked a little abnormal to me and Dr. Baack took my concerns and was very nice to explain to me what to look for. He was so nice to answer any questions I had to what else I should look for and keep an eye on.,Male
I went in to get a skin check (my family has a history of skin cancer) and he was super nice and listened to all my concerns. I will make sure to recommend him to my family to get their skin checks too since i feel so much better now!,Male

"Excellent knowledge of dermatology, very skillful in options for addressing issues, cares about his patients, engaging personality, etc.  Can't think of anything that isn't 5 stars.",Male
I've been trying to get an appointment with Dr. Baack for two months now. Twice through his web site. No reply. Then through his office; no call back and it's been 5 days. Would really like to get an appointment but don't know what I need to do short of standing on my head. That probably wouldn't get a response either. I don't understand why it's so hard.,Male
"Once I decided I was ready to have a breast lift/augmentation, I carefully considered all plastic surgeon options. I am a dermatology PA and so I've seen lots of good, bad, and ugly reconstructions.

"Dr. Bret Baack did a liposuction procedure on my legs, stomach, and love handle areas. He was very professional and made me feel very comfortable during appointments.

He really enjoys what he does and wants his patients to be happy with their results! He is an amazing doctor and plastic surgeon!!! ",Male
"He treats his patients with the prescription pad. He got me addicted to anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications and sleeping pills. I had to go to another doctor to get off of them safely.

"Dr. Baaj performed a laminectomy and fusion of my neck back in 2017. The results were horrific and I have been disabled and in excruciating pain since, despite dozens of treatments and procedures. Dr. Baaj glibly apologized after the surgery and passed me along to a pain management doctor that was affiliated with his hospital. I don’t think he could have cared less about the condition he left me in. I would never consider using Dr. Baaj for surgery and follow-up treatment. I have never heard from him again to check on my condition. He ruined my life, I am unable to do anything and experience unbearable pain every day.",Male
"Dr. Baaj operated on me in August 2019 for a rare condition called Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis (SEL). This is accumulation of fatty deposits in the spinal column and presents as numbness in the lower extremities. The operation involved a laminectomy of the thoracic spine, debridement of the lipomas surrounding the spinal cord, followed by thoracic fusion. The level of skill and precision for such an operation is beyond my comprehension. Everything turned out just fine and I was back at work in 8 weeks. Dr. Baaj was straightforward and empathetic at all times, even sparing me the fact that the operation was ""very risky"" until after the fact to spare me the fear and anxiety about a procedure that had to be performed. Over one year out, I am pain-free and the numbness in my feet is receding as nerves regenerate. Almost every day, I say to myself ""Thank you, Dr. Baaj""!",Male
"Absolutely I would  recommend Dr. ALI BAAJ,  he is a great professional,  a wonderful  human being!!
He helped my Mother greatly we are very  grateful to him.",Male

My experience has been superb and my results even better",Male
"Dr. Baaj was my surgeon for a 3-level ACDF spine procedure. He was caring, answered all my questions and above all, put me at ease before this major surgery. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone who is in need of a surgeon. He's the best.",Male

"Scheduling was easy. Nurses friendly and helpful. Dr. Baak-lots of red flags! Dr. Clearly did not review my medical history, nor did he have any interest in learning about my past medical history that potentially correlated to reason for visit. He discouraged me from seeing a neurologist after an abnormal brain MRI and increased neurological symptoms.He is very touching/ feely. Take how you will. I had I hopes for this Dr and left disappointed.",Male
"After 20 years of pain and multiple random diagnoses, I finally have some answers and some hope.

I am very pleased.",Male

"I have been a Dr. Baak patient for 4 months. Hands down this is the most organized, efficient doctor I have ever been too. The staff is outstanding and Dr. Baak was so thoughtful and investigative with my medical history and treatment.  He and I found a treatment on the 2nd office visit that was working and then my insurance pharmacy screwed up my prescription.  One of DR Baak’s assistants Katie helped me so much and went out of her way to get me another injection pen when my insurance company refused to help me and told me to pay out of pocket for their mistake.  The ultrasound lady Vickie was so reassuring about my RA scans  and helped me feel so much better that I actually hugged her when I was leaving the office.",Male
I have what is called an orphan disease. I never knew this stuff existing but after 4 different speciality doctors I ended up in Dr BAaks office.  Who knew there was a name for what has been thinking that I am losing sleep and have weird symptoms like cotton mouth and dry eyes.  This doctor knows how to give me the medicine to feel normal.,Male
"I took my grandma in to see Dr. Baak because she has had arthritis since she was a teenager and has been untreated her whole life. He was so kind when she was in the office with him, and really acknowledged her pain and what she was going through. He listened attentively and addressed all of her concerns. His staff was also very nice, from the receptionists, the medical assistants and the secretary that checked us out. Within less than a week of seeing Dr. Baak, she is already starting to walk small distances without her walker for the first time in 5 years. The first visit he spent 45 minutes with us and was willing to treat more than just her pain. He wanted to treat her as a person and the arthritis itself. She is so full of hope from just one visit and I can't wait to see where she will go from here.",Male
Dr. Baak has helped me more than any other doctors I have seen in the past 6 years. he listened to me and got me on treatment. his manager helped me get through a mess up at the cvs specialty pharmacy and stayed on the phonhe with me for over an hour to get my prescription square away.,Male
I have found Dr. Baak to be a wonderful doctor and his ladies are wonderful and the office feels warm like my home. ,Male
I have been a patient for 4 years and gotten great care. I am moving to San Antonia and when I told the office they said we will help you find another rheumatolgosit to transfer too and they set up an appointment and everything for me and faxd all my records there.  They did not have to do this but this is the kind of people they are. Very gracious.  Thank you Dr. Baak for all you have done for me.,Male
I am a new patient to this office. I found Dr. Baak to be very easy to speak to about my complicated medical issues. He was kind and spoke with confidence about me feeling better. Had a great first experience and I look forward to getting on track with my arthritis issues. I did not realize that my rash on my legs was my body flaring with arthritis. This is starting to make sense to me.,Male
"I have been a Dr. Baak patient for a little over 4 years.  I have Lupus and have been through a lot of different doctors, treatment and medicines.  Dr. Baak has saved me and had me on infusions for the past 2 years and 3 months.  This year 2020 my stupid insurance changed and they did not allow me to do the infusions that Dr. Baak has had me on.  His head nurse has gone above and beyond trying to help me and has been on multiple phone calls with my insurance company and helped me get Dr. Baak to write a letter to them.  Because of his staff I am being able to continue my infusions and can function well with my Lupus.",Male
"The doctors Wife Dolly, knocked once &amp; immediately walked in while I (female) was in exam room with the Doctor. She handed him papers to sign- Why could she not call him outside?
 What if I was being examined  and had been 1/2 naked? NOT OK! She is not a licensed medical caregiver. That happened twice . That's a MAJOR Hippaa violation. She thinks we are stupid.. The doctor is loved by older patrons,or by now he'd have major law suits because of his latest wife.. One can only conclude that she wanted to catch him in a lewd act. I left that practice. My insurance isn't paying for her to see my privates nor do I want her to see my privates.   I went to him for 16yrs. She soley has ruined that practice. Many negative reviews which feature his wife as an antagonist CANNOT BE WRONG!",Male
I feel so sorry for the office staff. They constantly look miserable. The nurse and receptionist are so nice but the last couple of times I went in for an appointment they were not smiling like their normal self. The doctor and his wife do not care who is in the office while yelling at their staff. I witnessed it right in front of me 2 months ago. Also the wait time is horrendous. I usually try to get the 1st appointment of the day thinking the doctor will be on time but he doesnt even show up until almost an hour after the 1st appointment. It's most definitely a shame. Then when you say something the doctors wife always has some snarky comment to make. Our time should matter also.,Male
Very good doctor.  Takes his time with you and answers all your questions.,Male
"Dr. Baaklini is a good doctor, but I switched due to long wait times and his wife running the front of the office. She claimed I missed appointments that I never made. I have seen her yelling at staff and even patients. One time I waited over three hours for my appointment (they refused to re-fill my medication unless I stayed). I ended up missing a quiz for a class. Other levels of negligence were present: he never told me about the HPV vaccine, important as a young female, so I didn't receive ",Male
Dr baaklini is a very nice man and treated me well. His wife runs the front office and is extremely rude I had to change my primary doctor because of her terrible attitude. They overbook so if you're not the first couple of people in your wait time will be one hour or more everytime.,Male
"He is the best doctor. My son was suffering from a bad virus that affect his breathing, his heart, stomach, swelling of his feetand loosing weight. I took him to his regular doctor that did the wrong blood test for him, heart doctor, GI doctor and no one knew how to diagnose his symptoms. As soon as I took him to dr. Michael, he knew right away the kind of virus and gave him the right medication. I would highly recommend him ",Male
Unprofessional staff!!,Male
Long wait. Drs wife is rude &amp; you cannot be seen if you forget your copay.  Him &amp; wife yells at staff.  Always on vacation or rescheduling appointments. Cannot keep staff for longer than 6months.  Will talk on &amp; on but loses focus on topic.,Male
"I cannot fathom the other reviews here. Dr. Michael is almost universally loved by his patients. The wait is a little long because when a person sits with him, there is a deep sense of focus and study. His background starting out in busy NYC hospitals means he has seen just about anything and everything. He is always there and always watchful and astute. He saved my life of course with some keen observations of a very complex report.. There is no way I can thank this man. Bill Kelly, Portsmouth",Male
"The wait exceeds an hour, sometimes 2 hours plus!Doctor acts like he cares, false reality.Numerous occasions prescribed me meds that have nothing to do with what intended for so started to google what the meds were for before taking them or applying them.Staff does not call to schedule appointments, does not call to notify change &amp; appointments often not in computer. After finding a new doc. got my diagnosis &amp; am feeling excellent. Took only 5yrs for me to realise I was going in circles here.",Male
Excellent,Male
"Dr. Baaklini is a God send.  She truly is an amazing woman and doctor.   She is caring,  compassionate and so thorough.  I feel so blest to have her as my doctor.

This was my First visit. Everything went perfect.,Female
Very impressed with this doctor and KS staff in general. He took time and was understanding of my issues. ,Male
If you look at each response by the doctor it says same thing.  I went to him several years ago and I was in tears when I left and I never went back.  He told me that he would not prescribe any pain killers only shots.  I am 72 years old and have severe spinal stenosis.  I don't think he even read my chart.  I felt like he did not care.  I was treated like a drug addict.  Not everyone that takes pain meds are addicts.   I have had chronic pain for years and have never abused my meds.  I take it because it eases my pain so I can function.  Something really needs to be done for the patients that have chronic pain.,Male
He is an excellent doctor! He really takes the time to listen to your problems and I strongly recommend him to you. He talks you through everything and I really couldn’t ask for a better doctor!,Male
Dr. Baalbaki and his team are wonderful! I’ve been suffering from neck pain and severe migraines for years and finally I feel like I have my life back in control again!  He is a true blessing and would recommend him and his team to anyone! ,Male
"I have been experiencing pain in the same location for &gt;23 years and on the same medication for the past 12 years with good control.  I was referred to this office for an intervention. Slowly, my medication is being taken away and I am being told I can’t handle pain, which is necessary for survival. I’ve been encouraged to try meditation. Each visit, he thinks my pain is in one place and not the actual place, despite having the chart in front of him. Maybe that is how things are done in Baghdad.",Male
"I just want everyone to know that you should avoid coming to this doctor. His only opinion is that you're not qualified for pain medication that you're only good for $2,500 spinal abrasion or shots in your back. Does not listen to what your previous physician treatments were. I just came out of his practice just a few minutes ago and he completely ignored my issue with severe intracranial vascular stenosis. My blood vessels in my brain are 50-80 percent blocked.  I have been told.by my neurolog",Male
All I Can say is he listens and advises me what to do. The Injections i get He Talk through it.,Male
"I was so disappointed with his demeanor. Not personable at all. I was having nerve block injection and instead of easing into it, it was a you will feel some pressure followed by a burning sensation Inserted the seringe and plunged away. I would rather got through another vasectomy. I was in tears by the third of four injections. I have canceled my appointments and deal with the pain. I am a human being in need of treatment, not an automobile being serviced for an alignment",Male
Despite multiple pain problems (WELL documented) he went back to lowest available dose at 2-3 times the interval designed. He either made a Medication ERROR or LIED to me saying he was Rx'ing extended release. Refused to add anything for breakthrough pain -- including POST OP! Rejected surgeon's strong advice to use liquid form (SAME DOSE). Tricare choices very limited; may HAVE to return. VERY long wait to get appts. Forgets details during appts.,Male
This guy is absolutely horrible.  He asked me the same questions twice I had already told him about.  I couldn't believe this guy wasn't listening.  Even though I've been in a pain clinic for 7 years and just relocated he basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about and my previous doctors were wrong.  Does not use main medications but will prescribe antidepressants because they've shown possible help but he will do injections.  Doesn't make $$ of prescriptions so injections will do,Male
Sat in the waiting room over an hour past my appointment time; believed him to be thorough in testing; however does not spend too much time w/patient.,Male
"Sat in the waiting room over an hour and a half PAST my appointment time then got about 90 seconds of the docs time. This place is a dirty, disorganized mess.",Male
Always an excellent experience. From start to finish. The office staff and nurses are amazing. Dr. Baalmann listens and works with you to accomplish your healthcare needs. They return calls in a very timely manner. I am glad to have found such a great healthcare team.,Male
"I was very impressed with Dr. Baalmann and have recommended him to many friends. He is very personable. Takes the time to listen to you and answer all of your questions. Is very thorough and, when my daughter had pneumonia, he went out of his way to call and check up on her the following week. Have been very impressed with him.",Male
"Don’t trust this man. He will lie to you. He lied to me. He replaced my long time Dr. Dr Mehta and said he would continue to treat my Pain Management the same as Dr Mehta. By the second visit he said no he wouldn’t do that and he required me to have a credit card on record. Even though I have Medicare and live on disability. Like a person living on disability and Medicare has a credit card. He had all my records available yet he was going to prescribe to me medications that I have an allergic reaction to. I guess it was too much trouble to look at my records. I was a patient at Northwest Family Physicians and of Dr Mehta for over 20 years and he had my full trust. It took all of two visits for me to lose my trust with Dr. Baalmann and, I wouldn’t recommend him to anyone.",Male
"Very personable, prompt and caring. New in practice, but wants to find answers to anything you ask if he doesn’t know. Excellent Physician!!",Male
"I have been going to Dr. Baalmann for over 10 years, she has delivered all three of my children and I can't say enough good things about her. Very caring and takes the time to listen. All of the staff are wonderful as well. Highly recommend",Female
"One of the absolutely worst doctors I’ve seen in my entire life. Dismissive, demeaning, God complex, lack of empathy, gaslighting, poor communication and listening skills, not thorough, doesn’t acknowledge autoimmune issues whatsoever. Do not visit this doctor.",Female
"Dr. Baar is my Oncologist. He is kind, gentle and compassionate. I never felt rushed. He answered my questions as well as my family’s questions. I would highly recommend him. I trusted him. His protocol for my treatment eliminated my cancer. He’s fantastic!!",Male
We have been patients of Rachel's for almost 12 years and she has been amazing. She answers our questions and there is never a stupid question. We have traveled from Utah county to see her.  Simply the best pediatrician around. We'll never change!,Female
Dr. Baars treats our whole family.  She is fantastic.,Female
"Best doctor EVER. She treats my entire family, as she is board certified in pediatrics and internal medicine. She is an excellent listener and explains everything. We all love her and my kids appreciate that she treats them like equals and doesn't talk down to them. My son describes her as ""sick"" (apparently that's a compliment...).",Female
"Dr Baars is the best!  She listens, spends time to determine best course and has an all around pleasant personality.  She really knows her stuff!  Her staff is great as well!  She is my main doctor.  Two thumbs up!!",Female
"I’m always treated with dignity and respect from the minute I walk into the office until I leave. Her staff is great and Dr Baars really listens to you. She takes action and follows up quickly.
She is personable and makes you feel so comfortable. So lucky to have found such a caring Dr.",Female
Dr. Baars has been my primary doctor for many years now.  She is so patient and answers all my questions.  I have been extremely happy with her as my doctor.,Female
"Without a doubt, Dr Baars is the best doctor I have ever had.  She is a great listener and helps me focus on the most important concerns I have.  I have been with Dr Baars for many years and have had an outstanding professional relationship with her.  In addition, I find that she is very thorough and compassionate to my health needs. ",Female
"Dr. Baars is by far the best primary care physician I've ever seen. She is very thorough, super intelligent &amp; the best is that she is sweet and makes you feel comfortable with your experience. I moved from LA to SF two years ago and cannot find a Dr. as great as her. I highly recommend her. ",Female
"Dr Baars has been my primary doctor for years. She is calming, listens to your concerns and wants the best for your health. She is well connected in the community so if you need a specialist she can recommend one that is close, trustworthy and an expert in their field of expertise. ",Female
"Terribly incompetent, and insisitive MD. She put my daughter through a wide range of unnecessary and harmful tests due lack of knowledge. Luckily, we changed doctors before she could do any more harm. 
I would give her zero stars if it was an option.",Female
Timely. Knowledgeable,Male
We have seen Dr. Baarson for back surgery consultation. He explained us how vertebral compression fracture can be treated. Dr. Baarson performed a kyphoplasty surgery for my mother. We are completely satisfied with a result and service. Thank you so much!,Male
"If you value your life, I’d stay away. This man performed surgery on my loved one and 12 hours later they were dead due to the blood supply totally cut off to 1 of their major organs. May as well play Russian Roulette.",Male
Doctor cut the blood supply to patients small bowel in surgery and she died. He never contacted the family. He struggled with the surgery and should have ended the surgery before doing more damage. He transferred the patient to sioux falls so another physician could tell us that he messed up and she was going to die,Male
Doctor killed family member in surgery,Male
"Dr. Baas is very knowledgable and personable, I would highly recommend him! ",Male
"I would recommend this physician highly. I had been  to three or four kidney MD's prior to seeing Dr. Baatarkhuu. She was friendly, with good chairside manner. She seemed concerned about my problem and after examining me, she explained everything in detail. She appears to have a lot of knowledge in the field of kidney disfunction. She took her time with me, to make sure I understood the issues. Dr. Baatarkhuu far provided me with the insight, that I was able to get from others in her field.",Female
"Attentive, kind, responsive, listens, knowledgeable, and consultative. Great bedside manner. Makes you feel important. Very professional and friendly from the very first moment I met her.",Female
"Dr. Jana is the best, I've known her a long time and have never had to wait.",Female
"Dr. Lara is the best, I've known her a long time and have never had to wait.",Female
Staff very helpful and polite. They all go out of their way to help. Dr. Ajrouche was beyond amazing I wasn’t able to wear shoes at all she made it happen very thankful for her and highly recommend her??????,Female
I have been a patient of Dr. Ajrouche for the past 7 years and I have always left more than satisfied. She is very through in how she treats my problems and extremely skilled. I would never consider another provider regardless of the distance. The bottom line is that I highly recommend anyone with foot problems to contact her office. In addition Dr. Ajrouche is very easy to talk to and communicates well. You can't afford to miss the opportunity to make an appointment,Female
"This doctor is truly exceptional. She truly cares about her patients and their well being. When she is treating the extremely sensitive foot issues, she does this in a compassionate manner. She has restored some of my faith in the American Medical Community. Dr. Ajrouse was not the first doctor I have seen with my issues. She is by far the best doctor I have had and one I would reccomend to anyone. I don't think I have ever been blessed with a better doctor.",Female
Can’t get a response from the doctor or her office. Started treatment and now no response via phone or email. Is she still practicing??? So disappointed. ,Female
"This doctor is the reason i have legs. I live in ky but grew up in michigan. Was assigned this MD randomly in hospital. God truly put this intelligent physician in my path. Was hospitalized after driving 6hrs to hospital because all i heard from ky physicians was amputation. Dr Janet said it could be saved. She have me options, referrals and TLC. I walk today because of her. How can you ever thank someone for their empathy? Great staff. Worth the drive. Caring with intelligence, great combo!!",Female
"Dr. Ajrouche took over the practice of Dr. Buto, whom I saw for many years.  Before he left he said he would turn his practice over to a really, good competent doctor and he sure did!  Dr. Ajrouche is top notch! She is an excellent doctor, i.e., knowledgable, thorough, intelligent, compassionate, considerate and sincerely cares about each and every one of her patients! She is totally dedicated to their care!  I feel very blessed to have her as my doctor! Thankful to Dr. Buto for finding her!!!",Female
Completely unprofessional: seats patients in a nasty room with contaminated equipment. Office Manager is rude. Allows medical equipment vendors to put notes in patient charts (which is against ANY policy in ANY health care setting). Makes up notes after the fact - lies about her patients.,Female
"Dr. Baatile-Ajrouche is great. I have been very disappointed with her office staff. They have been unprofessional, rude and had attitude and just not friendly or accommodating. I have referred the doctor to others but always provide a warning that the office staff is the worst. Also, I have had to wait over an hour during the day for a post-op appointment. Do not schedule multiple patients at the same time! ",Female
My apt. Was at 1:30pm. I never sw him and had to get back to work. I walked out at 3:10pm and told the secretary I had to leave. So disappointed about my waisted time.,Male
"I had open heart surgery in BSA hospital in Amarillo. Dr. Peter Baay was the surgeon. He did a great job. Thank you Doctor Peter Baay. I had very speed recovery because of you. Thank God to have you doing this for me. 
   Sameh Abualshaer. 
  ",Male
"Dr, Baay is recommended by other doctors, but he did not take time to explain my surgery in any way or give the opportunity for me to ask questions.  Pre-operative medications were not explained by his nurse at all--I had to do my own research.",Male
"I couldn't be happier with Dr. Z. She is wonderful.  So kind, thoughtful, compassionate and amazing at her job! I would recommend her to everyone. Her office staff is the best around and her nurses at the hospital are exceptional! ",Female
"Dr Boba was my family practitioner for 2 years on every medical need that I had brought up I found Dr Boba to be dismissive and overly questioning about my personal life. He also came across in a accusatory manner when examining my toddler. Asking me if he could check up on his special therapy through the township to ""make sure I was taking him"" asking me probing questions about our home life and diet more so then any other pediatrician I've ever used and I have a teenager. When I complained about having anxiety issues related to travel and asked for a a few days of anti anxiety medication.  after telling me that I shouldn't be nervous he immediately treated me like a junky looking for a fix. Had me take a urine test and not allowing my little son in the bathroom with me. When the test came back negative his nurse told me well you didn't have any drugs in your system at test time. 
All this over 10 low dose Xanax. I've since switched to a different ST Luke's practice and been much happ",Male
"So far, so good!  I haven't had an urgent appointment thus far, but both appointments that I had were very satisfactory. No complaints.  Dr. Baba spent the appropriate time with me and answered all of my questions.  Very nice man and good doctor. I heard in the past that the staff could be challenging; however, they've been great and very pleasant. ",Male
"Seems like a nice man...very poor doctor! Over a year with him, would not order me prescriptions, sent me to a specialist for everything. My neck became inflamed with cyst, he insisted it was from shaving irritation. I explained to him it was not. Would not listen to me.   Had other issues as well, digestive, anxiety etc. After changing doctors, my new nurse practitioner sent me for thyroid bloodwork. It was elevated, On synthroid meds, all the cyst gone in one day and I feel like a new man!",Male
Very Disappointing!!!! Was waiting in office for nearly ten minutes for an urgent medical issue and was told Baba couldn't see me and to reschedule. Traveling a half hour to get there I was upset with him and will be going to another Dr.,Male
"Good Care, Always smile, clear explanation.k,",Male
Great doctor! Cares a lot about his patients!,Male
Exceptional physician. Very courtesy and respectful. Took his time to explain by condition and what my treatment options were. ,Male
Terrible bedside manner. Was told repeatedly that my 85 year old Grandmother and aunt were hard of hearing yet he refused to raise his voice. Acted accusatory when trying to get patient history &amp; asked questions that had already been asked &amp; should've been documented. He obviously hadn't bothered to read her chart as he had to be told by family members present what had been done since she had been admitted and it was one simple med change. Refused to DC when all other docs wanted to.,Male
He has such a pleasant personality. So compassionate about his patient's overall health conditions. He kindly answers questions and enjoys training his patients on how to improve their lifestyles while living with Diabetics. He even educates all present family members. He is by far one of the best Endocrinologists that I have ever had. Many thanks to him and his sweet staff. Everyone is so patient and kind.,Male
"I LOVE GOING TO SEE DR. BABA,  AFTER HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND LOW THYROID ISSUES,  HE PUT ME ON THE PUMP WE HAVE GOTTEN MY A1C FROM 11 DOWN TO 8.2,  AND NOW HE IS TRYING TO GET MY THYROID LEVELS CORRECED,  I WILL SEE NO ONE ELSE,  EXCELLENT DOCTOR AND I ENJOY GOING TO SEE HIM.  GOOD BED SIDE MANNER.",Male
"I first saw dr baba 3 years ago for low energy, hair loss on my arms, legs &amp; scalp, fatigue, anxiety, weight gain, muscle loss, sleep disturbance, tinnitus anxiety. He ran basic thyroid test &amp; a few hormone tests &amp; he’d tell me to come back in 6 months. He did this for 3 years. On one visit, he prescribed me dhea &amp; also ran a dhea test that same day to determine my dhea level. Only after getting on the portal to look over my test results...did I realize my dhea levels were already too high. He never called me to tell me not to take the dhea, I had to call him to ask him about it. Every 6 mos I’d go back &amp; my symptoms were getting worse &amp; he’d run the same tests &amp; he’d tell me to come back in 6 months. Finally, I messaged him on the portal &amp; I was very polite &amp; basically begged him to run more tests &amp; to please help me figure out what’s wrong with me. His response...I dnt think your symptoms are hormone related. After 3 years...he’s now going to tell me this?",Male
Dr Baba has gotten my husband’s diabetes under control as it never has been. Sam listens to what he tells him. He is very informative and patient.,Male
Best Endo there is period. ,Male
I like Dr. Baba's professionalism and thoroughness in his exams.  He is always friendly and interested in anything I have to tell him.  ,Male
Excellent doctor and staff!! Very through with diagnosis and explanation. Has a ton of compassion for people! He is patient when you need extra help! My diabetes has never been better!! ,Male
"Wait time is usually long, but Dr spends time with you to make sure you understand what’s going on. He is polite, so are the nurses.",Male
"Truly an exceptional physician! Spends time listening and discussing to come up with the right plan of treatment for each patient.  Very compassionate, wonderful bedside manner and thorough in his labs and evaluation.",Male
Dr. Bab a knows how to Taylor the correct medication for each patient.  He is also a gentleman.,Male
Dr. Baba is very caring and really cares for ur health. Most doctors just know you by ur chart. Dr. Baba know you when he see you. He remembers who you are. He's truly one of the best Endocrinology around. I trust him with my life.,Male
"I am a Type 1 Diabetic, and he has helped me so much to get my A1C down. I use the Omnipod pump and he usually sets it at a good Setting. I would recommend him to any Type 1 diabetic, for sure. I'm sure he probably does great with Type 2 diabetics also.",Male
"He is a very caring and considerate Doctor.  Dr. Baba is very thorough.  he will work with you, give you the time to make you understand wheat you need to do and he is will help you in any way he can.  A very good doctor! ",Male
"Dr. Babaali is an excellent physician , for the last 5 years my mom has been his patient. He is diligent, caring with great bedside manner.",Male
"One of the worst, most disorganized, and disrespectful experiences I've ever had, doctor or otherwise. Doc was 1 HOUR late cuz he was just on the phone with someone, not sure it was even another patient. The reception nurse is rude. The office is dirty and cramped.",Male
"Dr. B is excellent, thorough and friendly. Clearly an expert, his exam was the most comprehensive and attentive I have ever experienced from an eye doctor. Highly recommended.",Male
I thought he was fine. 1st time seeing him as my eye dr retired and highly recommended Dr. Babad.,Male
"The doctor is awkward/creepy. He may have years of experience in his field, but he is not a good doctor. He allowed my son, who has 'Lazy Eye' to go with that condition for many years with NO treatment. We went to see a much better doctor in SC, who treated all of us with dignity and respect, and treated my son's condition successfully. This doc is a QUACK. His receptionist is a total BI**. I do NOT recommend this office AT ALL. Go to doctor ALLAMAN! Allaman is the best ever! ",Male
I will not recommend this pain doctor.   She did not know how to do my implant for a pain pump.  So her procedure to do so failed as the catheter was not secured properly and it came loose and out of place. ,Female
"Dr. Mo is wonderful! She is a caring physician who ensures you are comfortable, both with her and getting your pain under control. I highly recommend her.",Female
We have been  coming to your office for almost a year now we have had great success on managing   Chronic pain truly great doctor and staff ,Female
Very caring and detailed oriented. I've seen several Drs in the past 14 years and would wholeheartedly recommend her.,Female
"Rude and dismissive, with an arrogance that is vast in scope and scale. Avoid this judgmental doctor at all costs!",Male
"Refused to believe any of my tests that even he ran, saying they weren't ""definitive"" (gastric emptying test, his office did it the second time I had it). He said that even though the findings suggested severe gastroparesis BOTH times, as there was NO gastric emptying after 3 HOURS, not taking any medications, it was not gastroparesis. Told me to instead stop all NSAIDs for a couple YEARS despite severe back and joint pain. Very disappointed. Will not return or recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Babaev has been taking care of me for 5 years or so. Yesterday he did my 3d stent. He is extremely attentive, professional and knowledgeable. The procedure at NYU-Langone went great and I was home the same evening. Everything was so good that I cannot even think about one thing that needs improvement. Great doctor, great staff, great hospital.",Male
"Dr. Babaev is superb cardiologist . He has excellent procedural skills and my experience with him is unmatchable. Two years ago I was admitted to the hospital with severe chest pain and doctors in ER told me I was having heart attack. I was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and Dr. Babaev opened my blocked artery and implanted the stent. Since then I feel great, play golf every weekend and never had chest pain again. ",Male
He has terrible bedside manners. Treats the patients and their relatives like inferiors. Does not take time to explain the procedure /risks/ benefits/ causes/outcomes. Even 1 star review is too much for him. There are hundreds of  other well qualified physicians who could do what he does and treat you with basic  human respect and dignity.,Male
" Do not trust Dr Babaev, always ask for second opinion from another MD. My father was seen  by Dr Babaev in Brooklyn office. After running the test Dr Babaev  concluded that the  stent in the leg artery is only option for my father to reduce his leg pain.    Another doctor said that stent is not needed at all, because the blood in my father's legs is flowing well by using smaller arteries. Unfortunately, Dr Babaev put business first, not thinking about patient well being,",Male
"Thank You Dr Anvar A. Babaev. It was big pleasure to have you as doctor.So far I have no problems even I am working out on treadmill  and lifting weight . I just want to remind that you did for me two times procedure and each time you installed two stands 
",Male
"Does not care about patients well being. Feels like he's running a business not a medical office. My grandma needed a valve change, he referred her to one hospital with an invasive surgery option only. My grandma wanted only minimally invasive surgery because the risks are significantly lower and she is in her 80's. The dr. did not want to help with her request. she got the procedure done at another hospital w/o his help. When dr. found out  did not want my grandmother coming to him anymore.",Male
Very professional ,Female

Dr. Babai is the one the most competent doctors with superb ability in diagnosis and treatment. Highly recommend. ,Female
"Dr. Babai has a very bad temper and is very unprofessional as well as all of his office staff. I have only been seeing him for a short period of time, he is not very friendly and backtracks on his words often. Recently I had called in to get a document and I was yelled at by his ""nurse"" which was answering phones for some reason? He then calls me back later in the day, but ends up hanging up after a snarky remark made by him. I will not be returning nor do I have anything good to say about him. ",Male
"Have seen him for a long time, but this past year he has not been the same.  He actually yelled at me recently when I asked a question.  He seems to lack knowledge of of newer meds.  He wrote a script for me then got upset when I called for a refill, Even though it was ten days after a refill would have been due.  I heard his young receptionist make a catty remark about a patient. Maybe it is time to retire.  I'm not going back.",Male
"Frankly, he's too old, too confident in his pills, and too outdated on his information. I was taking Cymbalta for trauma. I told him I wanted off the pills after the side effects became worse than the problem. He insisted Cymbalta had no withdrawal &amp; gave me no action plan for going off the pills. I've been nauseous &amp; vomiting for 2 weeks now as I go through the withdrawal he claimed didn't exist. Even the FDA suggests an action plan for averting Cymbalta withdrawal. Not a very good doctor.",Male
This doctor never asked me what my problems were except that he knew I had social anxiety because it was written in a sheet.  I had depression too but we never talked about anything.  Then I said I was seeing a psychologist next door and he said if I saw the psychologist I could not see him.  Well I stopped seeing the psychologist and tried to get back in to see Babai and he would nkt see me and his secretary actually screamed at me.  ,Male
Dr. Babai is thorough and takes her time. She has great bedside manner &amp; makes me feel comfortable.,Female
Wonderful physician great bedside manner takes time with you.,Female
Great dr!!!,Male
I was referred to Dr. Babaian after my PSA numbers were higher than normal.   After the results were back from the lab she called my to give me the results.  She gave me the feeling she really cares.  At my previous urologist I was told by the nurse practitioner that she would call.   I am still waiting.            I was extremely pleased with Dr Bahaian as my urologist.,Female
"Highly recommended for a colonoscopy.  Procedure was painless. I was well sedated. When I woke up, I remembered nothing.",Male
"I’ve been going to dr Babaian since January 2019. His staff is amazing. No wait when I go in, Nancy is a sweetheart she’s very attentive and knows the answer to everything. I appreciate them",Male
"At first, Dr. Babaian seemed to be a very personable physician.
Seemed concerned and caring. But by the end of my first
encounter with him, he was bragging that he did 18 colonoscopies
in one day. I felt like I was just another ""A"" to him! Does a physician
really have to be such a braggard about such intimate procedures?
I'd never refer him to anyone nor did I ever return to his office.
He may be a good doctor but his attitude leaves much to be 
desired.",Male
"Fantastic office , staff &amp; doctor",Male
My review is was supposed to show 5 stars . Hope the website will fix it,Male
"He's been my ""GI"" for over 2 years now, +/-. He's taken care of an acute esophagus condition I had &amp; continues to manage it. He talked me into having a procedure I SWORE I'd never have, a colonoscopy. Nothing spectacular. I'm sure most gastroenterologists would've been able to tackle it. So, what's so great about him? Besides his expertise, knowledge &amp; vast experience, he's absolutely charming bedside manners. He takes the time to really listen to you &amp; puts you at ease. To me, that's priceless!",Male
Dr Babaian may (or may not) be a good doctor but I can't comment on that since I never had any follow-up on my procedures due to his staff's incompetence &amp; unwillingness to help get a referral for the follow-up appt from my insurance. Considering how many of these G/I guys there are around this area - I recommend that you pick a different one...,Male
I needed a colonoscopy.  Dr. Babaian was very good and his staff was easy to work with.,Male
"Great Doctor, great staff. Dr B. is a good listener and takes all the necessary time to do a complete and thorough check-up. Bonus: The appointments run on time!",Male
Very Pleasant and nice staff,Male
Dr. Babaian and his entire staff + the Coral Springs Clinic (and staff) he referred me to gave top notch care + excellent customer service and follow up. In my 3 years of living in South Florida this was a new and very welcome experience.  Kudos to all.,Male

"Previous to Obama Care I was denied insurance, due to having Crohn's disease, a pre-existing condition. While working per diem at a public hospital I became very sick and needed my gallbladder removed. Dr. Babaian put a stent inside of me a few days before my operation. About a week after the surgery the stent became quite painful and needed to be removed. An appointment was scheduled at Dr. Babaian's office where I was told that he would not remove the stent unless I paid him $3000 up front.",Male
Unprofessional and Money Minded.,Female
"I have been a patient of Dr. Babaian's for the past 14 years, and have never found such a personable, likeable, and ""really listens"" to you type of doctor that she is.  Dr. Babaian is more like a family member, and welcomes you into her office like a second home.   She really takes care of her patients, and makes you feel like you're top priority, and will accommodate and diagnose you with sincerity.  I LOVE Dr. Babaian - she is the best!!!  I travel about 150 miles (roundtrip) to come visit.",Female
"I am sure Dr Babaian is a wonderful doctor- if you can ever get in to see her. Her staff told me that my severe pain was an acute issue for them and that they would not be scheduling me until 2 months down the road. They were rude, promised a call back I never received and then hung up on me when I tried to follow up. My hopes in writing this review is that Dr. Babaian reads this so she knows how people that are trying to schedule with her are being treated.",Female
"Very bad experience, my insurance covers physical, but this place decided to split in 2 visits so that they can charge me for a co-pay. This place is all about money. Avoid this place.",Female
"Too many visits for tests on different days/at different facilities.  The bills keep piling up.  Me thinks she's workin' the system, considering some (most?) of the tests (that I recognized) were irrelevant to my condition/reason for visiting.  Hep A/B/C?

Her PA is an idiot. Prescribed a BP med that causes unpredictable variances in blood glucose levels (Type 1 diabetic).

Despite a visit last year, and 2 this calendar year, I have yet to actually SEE the doctor.",Female
"I was a patient of Dr Babaian for a short time.  While everyone was caring and kind, I had difficulties making the many appointments that were needed for tests and results.  I never understood why all these tests couldn't be scheduled for 1 day and the results on another day.  Instead I had 3 test appointments and 3 followup appointments.  Excessive and a waste of my insurance benefits.",Female

I’ll be looking for another internal female Dr this center doesn’t hv internal female dr ! ",Female
She figured out what was wrong with me.  I've been to 6 other doctors and they couldn't tell me or they just gave me pills to mask it.  She gave me my life back! Thank you Dr. B!,Female
She actually paid attention to what I said and we were able to take off a bunch of my medications that had been added on over the years that I didn't know why I was still on.  No other doctor had done that and I had been to 3 other general doctors in the past 4 years.  I did have to wait about 30 minutes for the appointment sitting in the room but I would wait whatever it took because I actually trust this doctor because she treated me like an actual person.,Female

 Only Primary Doctor in Offíce 
See's patients three days a week.  
If you are sick and need to see her with short notice she will not fit you.

My experience with Dr. Babaie was amazing. She listened to me and helped me tremendously. Best doctor I've ever been to.,Female
"Dr Babaie was able to look at my past medical records, past diagnosis' and medication list and change my life forever!  She listened to Me!

"I have been a patient of Dr. Babajanian for close to 28 years. He is by far the most compassionate, caring and patient Doctor who has always exceeded any expectations and treated me as I was a family member.  I have been taking my daughters to him any time needed for 23 years and they absolutely trust him and know he will take care of them.
Making appointments have at all times been quick and the wait has always been under 10 minutes. He always had time to talk to me any time of the day, caring for my father who had a tracheotomy even took time out of his weekends and changed his trach and took time to call and support me and my parents for as long as I can remember....I along with every member of my family are truly blessed to have him as our doctor and now friend",Male
Referred for removal of a large obstructive nasal polyp. Conservative treatment was tried first but eventually surgery was needed. Surgery was uneventful with no post operative problems. He showed great care and concern. Very professional. Highly recommended,Male
"I to this doctor complaining of a sinus infection. He recommended that I use an antibiotic ointment and proceeded to put some in my nose. Using the same swab, he dipped it into the tube and started to put it in the second nostril. I went ballistic! I said, that’s is not sterile technique! You could be infecting me and other patients by contaminating that tube with my swab. You cannot do that. Viruses are not killed by antibiotics and you could be passing them to the next patient.
He asked how I could possibly know that, and I said because I’m a healthcare provider. I told him the tube of ointment probably cost him a dollar and if he wanted to give the patient the tube that was different but he needed to stop his current technique.
I will never go to this doctor again and have told all my friends and internist who referred me about the incident.",Male
"Dr Babajanian is a conservative physician as well as a kind and excellent listener who takes his time explaining his decisions and makes sure you understand everything. His office is great as well, just really nice and personable. I can not recommend Dr Babajanian highly enough!",Male
"The best at his specialty for sure! Had polyps removed from my sinuses in 2011 and from the time of the first appointment to the actual surgery, I felt in good hands. There is a reason why every doctor recommends Dr. Babajanian. I was at work a day after my surgery. Unbelievably professional, very friendly! Can't believe I had not left a review since my surgery!",Male
"Dr. Babajanian performed my hemithyroidectomy. He is thorough, meticulous, and takes great care in explaining pre and post-operative procedures and issues. His staff is excellent and both he and they are responsive and caring people. His reputation as an excellent surgeon proved more than true from my experience. ",Male
"I am extremely grateful for the expertise of Dr. Babajanian. He removed a large tumor from my salivary gland, saving my facial nerve.  From the first appointment where he spent nearly an hour getting to know me, patiently answering my questions, to reassuring me before the surgery and finally investigating my case further and checking to see how my recovery was going, I was so impressed by his knowledge and compassion for me as his patient. I am honored to have Dr. B on my team.",Male
"God bless Dr.  Babajanian. I had difficulty breathing through my nose for several years.  Allergists and pulmonologists gave me sprays and drugs. None of them worked, but they did have side effects. Finally I saw Dr. Babajanian who said I had a structural defect in my nose that could only be fixed by surgery.  Dr. Babajanian operated and now I can breathe again.  I threw all the sprays and drugs in the trash can.",Male
"My partner got a referral due to receiving a positive lupus test. She called and was told to wait for a call back. Two months later, no word, so she called and asked, was put on hold for ages, and then was told by the doctor’s staff that her referral was lost. Never mind that she received confirmation from her insurance that the referral had gone through — Dr. Babajanians lost her referral and thus all that waiting was for nothing.",Male
He completely ignored my records when I transferred to Riverside medical clinic. He bases treatment completely on blood tests without checking other observable indicators that were documented in my medical records.,Male
"I never met the guy. Had an emergency gallbladder removal, in hospital and with surgeon in my network. He was called in as an assistant, apparently. He’s not in my network, I was charged $20k out of pocket.",Male
"Dr Babakhani did a gallbladder surgery on my husband in August 2016. My husband was admitted to Florida hospital for 5 days. The doctor never mentioned that they do not contract with BCBS during his 5 minute $3500.00 consult. The Dr said that he would put a few stitches in a lower abdominal hernia for a temporary fix since he was already going to be in there. BCBS pd them less than a $1000. He charged for 2 FULL surgeries for himself AND 2 for ASSISTANT! ($35,500.OO EACH). OUR BALANCE $74,000.00",Male
Very competent and thoughtful.,Male
"Have been seeing Dr Babakhanian for about 1 1/2 years. Was skeptical at first as my insurance told me I had to see him and I didn't know anything about him. I was  hesitant since I am a medical provider. I could not be more happy that I was sent to see him. He has left no stone unturned, has called me to check on me, has referred me to other specialists (including USC) to get the right answers and treatments. The takeaway for me is that he really knows what he's doing and he cares even more.",Male
"Great doctor! Very thoughtful and listens to your concerns without interrupting. He took proper care to address my needs as a patient with a rare disease, such as doing my endoscopy in hospital and listened to my concerns about gi issues associated with my illness.

"Dr. B is very kind and patient.  Seems to really care about his patients issues.  Makes you feel comfortable. Easy to talk too.  The only reason I rated a 2 star in the urgent appt. scheduling is because he is so busy, you still have to wait a while before you can see him.",Male

First of all she has Wonderful beside manner she explains what she is doing and if you don't underdstand she  will break it down so when you leave you will... she will call herself instead of staff if there is an issue or if you miss to many appointment....

If you want a great Doctor I suggest you choose her you will NOT be disappointed.,Female
"Dr. Babaloa is an amazing doctor! My insurance company however was no longer accepted so I had to leave. Here recently I switched insurance carriers and thought I would try her office again, because I loved her so much! I called and the young lady at the front office was rude per usual. I wrote this to say. The front desk will be the reason people shy from this practice. She is the direct line of communication with people, and if she can't provide quality service it will turn people away. ",Female
"Rude, Uneducated Staff. Delayed Lab Results. Over Billing.Unnecessary Testing.  Takes Advantage Of Senior Patients.",Female
"Dr. Babalola is very unprofessional. I went to her office to have a consultation regarding a private matter and she wanted me to have the conversation in the front office.
She lacks knowledge of medications needed to treat certain conditions, and does not bother to take a few minutes to research and educate herself about current medicine.",Female

She was able to administer the vancomycin while protecting her kidneys and balancing the fluids so my mom was not dehydrated. To date no doctor has been able to keep her creatinine, sodium and GFR under control while receiving antibiotics. She has giving my family advice that I used to coordinate care when we weren't sure what to do. She is the only hospitalist I  encountered with a group of residents shadowing her. ",Female
"Dr. Babameto prescribed a medication that was not appropriate for the type of bowel disease that I have. I did not know this until I switched doctors. He was unclear in his communication with me, and did not follow up with me when he said he would. He may be an intelligent man, but he needs to listen to his patients who tell him of autoimmune diseases in their family which can be linked to their own. He is unreliable and comes across like a nutty professor. Nurse and receptionist are excellent.",Male
I see Dr. usually about every three months.  I had a stent put in under her guidance about 3 years ago.,Female
Dr. Baban saved my husband’s life and I will forever be grateful to her.

Two days ago I had a procedure performed by Dr. Baban at Palomar hospital.  She is very skilled and did much to make this patient comfortable.  The angiogram went smoothly and the entire team worked well together.  There were no complications.  ,Female
Most unhelpful staff I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with! Doctor is not even recognized by Graybill. Instead of being accommodating her staff was intentionally obstinate. Any time a doctor's staff is purposefully obstructive its a good reason not to expect much from the physician... Waste of time! ,Female
"He treated me a week ago as i was real sick and in extremem pain..The doctor was so kind, sweet, understanding and made sure i knew every detail of my ilness and he made sure that i understood that he was going to do everything in his power to make me well..Dr Baban is one of the greatest doctors i have ever had the pleasure of meeting and working with..i will never forget this great man...Thank you Dr Baban, you are the best   Vickie Adkins",Male

"Love Dr Babaoff!  I have been a patient of Dr Babaoff for 45 years.   I have always found his care to be performed with great compassion and completeness.  When I went into labor and my husband was out of town....he offered to meet me at the hospital before he actually had to be there.  Fortunately my husband flew home in time for the birth of our baby.  On the occasion when I was ill, I could always get in to see  Dr Babaoff . I am now nearly 65 years old and still trust the care I receive.",Male
"I was referred to this office by multiple people. With this, I thought I'd have the same exceptional trust and experiences with the office. Dr. Babaoff has played off the questions I have been asking since my first visits. Instead, he recommends more costly procedures and blocks me from other resources until I'm backed into a position where I have to go with his extensive and expensive route. It is sad and a hurtful feeling to feel scammed by people you think you're paying to trust. ",Male
He saw me via teleconference Tuesday. Very effective way to connect. The optics worked well. He is quite personable and caring.,Male
"Really wonderful clinician. Dr. Babaoff spent more time than he should have during my first visit listening to all of my concerns and talking through every aspect of what I was seeing him for.

"Dr. Babaoff is young but is very knowledgeable. Seems to listen
 Hard changing doctorsand took awhile to get used to but pleased with his care.",Male
"After developing a general distrust of doctors, it took me a while to be honest with Dr. Babaoff (and my family) about on-going issues I was facing. However, Dr. Babaoff gained my trust with his professionalism and how he listens to everything you say.  He then offers real options and medically-backed solutions.  It's obvious that he stays on top of the latest studies.  I look forward to many years together.",Male
"Dr. Babapour is one of the most courteous doctors I have had the pleasure of going to. Having another doctor in the same building, I decided to try him upon a recommendation. His front office was a pleasure. After listening to my concerns he got right to the issue in a no nonsense manner, all the while keeping me at ease. His approach is very professional combined with a feeling of truly personalized care. A very positive experience. Highly recommended. I can’t say enough about this gentleman.",Male

"Didn't ask any questions about my conditions, didn't offer any recommendations after being on the same medication for 5 years and being disabled tells me I need to quit taking pain meds after 3 failed back surgery two failed neurostimulators and every other thing I have tried. Didn't ask me one question came in the room the first time I've ever met him and said I don't need them. He's a helluva doc to look at someone and within less than 2 min tell me what I need. I'll never see him again.",Male
"Never would recommend this guy to anybody!   cold, uncaring, hates-his-job. ",Male
This was my third time with him and it will be the last.He barely seemed concerned about my well being and really didn't ask questions.Too bad because the first time I went 9 months ago he seemed more caring.,Male
Poor bedside manners. Lack of respect. Arrogant doctor. He does not know how to treat kids. Do not recommend this doctor.,Male
The office staff is horrendous. Never not once do they answer or return phone calls. I waited 4 days before I showed up just to get someone to help with a medication issue. once the dr fixed the medication they then called in or faxed the wrong dosage. I called back and no one ever responded. I literally gave up trying to get through to them.,Male
"I consistently feel that Dr Babar doesn't take my case seriously and feeds me stock answers. I'm the one with the condition, and I know those answers already. I need further insight from my healthcare provider. I've been unsure about next steps in the process and whenever I call, I have to leave a message. When I hear back, I have to explain my history every time even though they know me and should have my history in 17 different places by now. Very unhappy with my experience on many levels.",Male
"I trust Dr. Babar. She listens to my concerns, keeps track of my health history and recommends options to improve my overall health. I never feel rushed through my appointment and I feel like she truly cares about my well being. I highly recommend her!",Female
I had been with my previous Dr for many years and he retired. So I came in with a bit of bias. I am very a happy with Dr. Babar. She listens to what the issue is and takes very good care of me. My husband is seeing her and he is happy also. I suggest her to anyone who is looking for a good Dr.,Female
I am a breastfeeding mother and I asked to be switched to a different brand of birth control. The doctor knew this as we discussed it for a few minutes. Upon arriving at the pharmacy I noticed the warning label on the birth control that said do not use if breastfeeding. I feel like if I didn’t check it myself my son could have been harmed. I think the doctor should have done her research before prescribing this brand. Will not recommend.,Female
 Best doctor ever.  She is kind and caring and makes sure she goes over everything with you before you leave her office. She deeply explains what is going on and refers you to another doctor if you have more problems than what she thinks for further evaluation. She is a wonderful person and treats you with respect and goes out of her way to make sure you get  better ,Female
"I just started seeing Dr. Babar as I have had many issues with previous Doctors.  I have to say, personally, she is amazing!

Dr Chen is awesome.  He’s very personable and pleasant.  He answers your questions thoroughly and he always has a very calming effect.  I would highly recommend him,Male
"Dr. Chen and the whole team at acuity eye group are great. I really appricated their fast, courteous, and professional service. Im very impressed by Ashley (who runs the front office).  I dont know what you pay her, but its not enough. Thanks",Male
Received very well and was given quick and very accurate diagnosis with necessary treatment to follow. Dr Culotta very honest and straight forward. I trust him.,Male
Probably one of the best doctor visits I’ve ever had. They got you in on time. Processed quickly. Got you with the doctor immediately. And was out the door in less than a half an hour.,Male
At each visit I have received prompt and pleasant service.  The staff is patient and caring.,Male
"While I hate to keep going into doctor for check up visits, understand Doctor concerns.  Feel my case must be a bit unusual, thoroughness is this doctor’s pattern.",Male
"Dr. Culotta was very proficient in what he does. Pleasant, but to the point. He wasted no time. The office staff was amazingly organized and friendly at the same time. It was a ""ten"" experience for sure.  I differently recommend this Dr office. The total experience was very good!",Male
The doctor and staff were Courteous and quick,Male
Absolutely! Dr Culotta is such a dedicated physician as well as a nice person. I have been his patient for over a decade and it is always a pleasure to visit him.,Male
"Incredibly organized and efficient 
Office staff and assistants.  Friendly and warm personalities.",Male
The office is busy but all things ran smoothly. The office assistants were kind and gracious. Dr.. Culotta is quiet but polite and helpful. I liked him.,Male
Staff is very professional and nice!  Great place!,Male
"Marissa is a wonderful, caring and intelligent provider. She made me feel so comfortable and secure. ",Female
Love this Dr. very helpful!,Male
"I give Dr. Joselito Cabaccan, my highest recommendation.
He is:  an excellent doctor, kind &amp; considerate, communicates well, answers questions.",Male
"I like dr Cabaccan and feel he is very knowledgeable and has a good bedside manner. I also received a letter dropping me as a patient with no explanation. When I called his office to ask why, they put me on hold for 20 min before I hung up. I’ve called multiple times leaving messages, with no response. Luckily my issue does not need immediate attention. Don’t recommend at this time.",Male
I always enjoyed my visits with Dr. Cabaccan and found him very easy to work with and always offered me the latest information to treat my diabetes.  That said I just received a notice from his office that I was being dropped as a patient without any explanation.  I'm in shock and am scrambling to find another endocrinologist before my medications run out.  I feel like I've been left out in the cold.  Proceed with caution.,Male
Dr Cabaccan is treating me for osteoperosis and thyroid issues. He found a treatment for my osteoperosis that was very difficult to get my insurance company to pay for and I'm one of very few patients that have used it. The results have been better than I could have hoped for. He answers all my questions and seems to be well acquainted with my issues when I go in for a visit.,Male
I  highly recommended Dr Cabaccan.  He takes time to listen and answers all questions.  He was able to lower my AIC for a short period of time.,Male
"Never got to see Dr. Cabbacan, only nurse practitioner. There is only one front office staff member, who lost my insurance card. I had to do the same labs twice due to a ""clerical error"". They are unwilling to reschedule appointments because I have to work and dropped me as a patient. For people who want to take care of their health but also have to work to pay the bills in this Bay area, this is not the place to go. ",Male
Have highly recommended him to several family members. He listens and answers all questions/conerns.,Male
"Dr. Cabbacan was very dismissive when I tried to discuss issues I was having. In addition to not listening to me, I have had type 1 diabetes for over 20 years and he talked to me as if I’ve i had just been diagnosed.He also would not refill my insulin prescription (which i need for basic survival) when I was not able to return for an office visit after my former prescriptions ran out. If you want a a doctor who prioritizes your needs as a patient and listens to you, do not see Dr. Cabaccan",Male
"Dr Cabaccan is clear,concise and brings a sense of humor to his communication style. He is also an excellent physician. Stanford educated and well versed in diseases of the endocrine system. ",Male
"I 1st saw Dr. Cabaccan after Kaiser wanted to remove my thyroid.  Since then, I don't have problems with my thyroid, I haven't had surgery and I travel from Roseville to San Jose for annual check-ups.  He's the most caring doctor I've ever seen and, I'm a breast cancer survivor so I've seen plenty of dr.s    I wish all dr.s were as concerned about their patients, as Dr. Cabaccan.  He's worth the wait, you won't have any regrets.",Male
"He is my moms dr (I live in Switzerland or else I'd be his patient for sure). He is Incredibly caring and personable and really digs in to figure out what is going on, not many MD's are willing to do that these days unfortunately. Go see him, i don't think you will be disappointed;-)",Male
"Dr Cabaccan was nice, however, being able to get in to see him takes forever! The office doesn't call you with your test results and after calling them they never called me back. I need a practice that is there for me not just a nice Doctor. I will be finding a different Doctor!!",Male
"Dr Cabaccan is a wonderful, caring, knowledgeable physician. My first visit, 5 years ago was informative and detailed. I was referred after being diagnosed with diabetes. Dr Cabaccan has explained the disease in detail I would and have referred family and friends to him.",Male
"He was able to diagnose the condition but it was all downhill from there. After months of this infusion, I continued to worsen to the point I was home bound and it was painful to even move, I complained forcefully as I worsened and I was sent a letter discharging me as a patient! Discrimination at its best.",Male
"Verdict still out. Might switch to another physician. Unlike any rheumatologist I’ve ever been to. Never checked my joints. Never examined hands &amp; feet. Never checked reflexes.  And it wasn’t because of COVID because unlike me, he didn’t wear a mask. I didn’t leave with confidence that he understood my condition. I did leave with a nagging feeling he didn’t care. He also mentioned I had taken up too much of his time. My labs came back with some alarming results. Elevated antibodies &amp; red blood cells, low C02 &amp; vitamin D. My GP responded to Dr. Cabacungan’s labs immediately &amp; did a Zoom follow up the next day. Dr Cabacungan - nothing. We had an appointment one month out, I guess he figured that was good enough. His office never told me the labs had issues. I had to call &amp; follow up &amp; discover the issues on my own, &amp; forward them to my GP.  All of this compounds my “feeling“ that this doctor doesn’t care, and so might not be the best doctor to help me manage my autoimmune conditions.",Male
"This ""medical"" practice is horrible.  The staff lies to cover their own incompetence and if you question it you are scolded like a child and threatened to be terminated from the practice.  Please read some of the other comments, this is not a one time situation, it is common practice here.  They are willing to threaten to leave a person without medical care simply for expecting them to do their jobs.",Male
"This office is absolutely the worst as far a being managed and it gets worse from there.  You will not reach anyone by phone, ever.  You are told to use the patient portal but will not receive a response.  Dr. tells you to stop medications, we are going to try a different one and will need a pre-authorization from the insurance.  Waited three weeks, nothing, called my insurance, office never submitted for the pre auth.  Another time insurance needed more info, office never responded.  Stay away unless you are perfectly healthy and will never need to see the doctor.  Now they have a PA that ""sees"" patients so the actual doctor only sees you every three visits even if your disease is not under control.  Anyone who has ever dealt with autoimmune disease knows how devastating this kind of neglect can be.  No caring here.  Last time I saw the doctor he never even looked at my swollen joints, he's so afraid of having sick people in the office he would rather we go to urgent care.",Male
"Romy is fabulous. Super knowledgeable and confident. Despite have a chronic immune system disorder, and ongoing issues, his direction and advice help me to feel as if it’s a disease I can manage.",Male
After getting the runaround about getting my test reports along with the lies the first thing I noticed was that the TSH Report was not included so I ask Rebeca why this report didn’t have it and she said that he didn’t order it. The TSH report has been included in every test result that I have had done since going there. It just so happens that my primary doctor had my bloodwork done and my thyroid level was low and I had to be put on stronger meds for it. As this is his second review from me and both being lied too I do not recommend this doctor to anyone needing a rheumatologist. When all you get is excuses and or lies I would say he is not trustworthy!,Male
"He is fast but impersonal. Spent all his time focused on explaining his actions to a resident he did not ask my permission to include in our initial visit. He barely looked at me and did not touch or look at my hands at all to check for symptoms, swelling, etc. He is rude and insensitive.  A dr who wants a clear cut test result not interested in truly figuring out the problem and how to help you. ",Male
"Absolutely satisfied with my visit and the treatment and follow up with Dr. C.  I have already recommended him to others, including my husband, who is also delighted with the care he received.",Male
"Dr. Cabacungan is very friendly, patient and listens to my concerns.",Male
"Dr. Romy is the 5th Doctor I have seen for my condition. He spent 45 minutes with me to help figure out a diagnosis. He listened to my concerns, answered my questions and explained his thoughts and reviewed his plan of care. I am impressed so far and look forward to seeing him again. He seemed to care and I appreciated when he said if Doctors listen to their patients they will tell them something.",Male
"I don't really understand all of the great reviews of this rheumatologist. I recently moved to AZ and was assigned Dr. C through my insurance. He spoke more about his own back pain and gout that anything about me. He never remembered what medications I was on or what therapies we had already talked about. He made fun of his other patients who had sleep apnea (""with their big, huge necks"") and seemed confused when I spoke with him about other therapies my previous rheumatologist had tried. ",Male
"He is the best Rheumatologist on the planet. Pleasant personality, knowledgeable, current in new emerging illnesses, thorough in implementing diagnostic work up in order to go to the bottom of identifying the etiology of any medical condition, adopts appropriate intervention for the treatment. Words are not enough to thank him and to appreciate him. We do need more physicians like Dr. Cabacungan for obtaining quality medical care. I highly recommend him. ",Male
"One of the best doctors I know! Professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy. I will not go to any other rheumatologist than Dr Cabacungan. ",Male
He is amazing. Made me feel comfortable and listened to everything I had to say about where I was hurting. Never felt so relaxed and cared for. Thank you.  ,Male
Dr Romy really listened to me when a lot of other doctors didn't. He is very informative in what tests he orders and went over all the normal and abnormal tests in detail. He took his time and went over lupus. He doesn't just throw medications at you. He actually gave me options and I got to choose what I was comfortable with. I am currently pain free for the first time in months. I highly recommend him.,Male
Dr Cabacungan is very knowledgeable and down to earth. I highly recommend him.,Male
"Bottom line, Dr Cabacungan takes care of his patients.",Male
Great experience. This was my first visit with Dr Cabacungan. My wife and I are new to the area and establishing ourselves with new doctors. We were very impressed with him.,Male
Dr. Romy is an amazing physician. He was very attentive and knowledgeable. He spent a great amount of time to address all my issues. I would highly recommend him. ,Male
Dr. Romy is an amazing doctor. He was very empathetic with my problem and was able to treat me accordingly. ,Male
"This doctor totally failed me. I was very ill and had tested positive for a trop disease. My regular docs wanted me to see a trop dis specialist, and recommended UTMB. They told me to bring specimens, photos, test results. The specialist refused to look at the items. He acted like he didn't believe I had been referred. He told me he would research and get back to me by portal, but I never heard from him again. I was very ill and sent him a follow-up message asking for help but he didn't answer. ",Male
Does anyone know where dr cabagnot is at now. I saw him for years then he left wakefield medical,Male
Dr Cabagnot was my doctor for several years. He is wonderful. His office is always packed because everyone wants to be treated with him. The wait is totally worth it. He is hands down the best doctor you will ever encounter. It's a shame he will retire soon. I love him. He will be missed.,Male
Great Dr! The office is busy often just be patient... Please update the address not in Yonkers anymore... The best group ever I recommend this office they really care about you. I travel from Yonkers to see this Dr. ,Male
"Worst experience ever after calling asking if I could come in for a physical and them saying yes I waited for 3hrs for someone to tell me we have to reschedule ..,I called I even went up to front desk for idea of wait she told me one more person...don't bite off more than you can chew...simple!.....I should have never been told to come or wait for 3hrs for you to tell me he's very busy...I'm disgusted been coming here for years I'm beyond dissatisfied!...never again!",Male
"Generally unavailable and unreceptive to concerns. Discontinued a blood thinner prescription for blood clots with no explanation or reasoning, then was not reachable when I tried to refill it. Request a different hospitalist!",Female
"Office staff is the most unprofessional I have dealt with my entire life.  The rudest, angry office manager I had the displeasure of speaking with and will have to find a new Doctor",Male
"In all fairness I did not know how to rate Dr Cabahug as I walked out before being seen. After spending 35 minutes completing the New Patient forms, I was nearing the end when I saw a $75 fee for being 15 minutes late - $25 is more the norm. But what sent me walking was the 2% charge for using a credit card to pay one's bill. (My bill would be about $275 per quarter.) This is just outrageous as it so far out of the norm for any medical practice. (Also, for all of these exhorbitant fees , it was surprising to see such a shortage of seats in the waiting area. I got the last one and the patient after me had to go outside.)",Male
"I was suffering from severe tinnitus, headaches, dizziness, and lethargy &amp; weakness. After having a CT scan of the brain, I was told by the Neuro-Radiologist that I probably coming in for MS. My wife was petrified &amp; very upset when she heard that. We went to Dr. Cabahug who checked me thoroughly and reviewed all my lab reports and CT scans and gave a definite NO!  He said ""you do not &amp; is not coming in for MS"". He treated my other symptoms and till date after over five years I am totally normal and healthy as ever.",Male
"Doctor Cabahug, was  my  doc years ago, when  i was in  henderson/vegas .he  is  awesome, kind and smart.  i didnt  have to  worry about  my  health with  this  negoligist ,  really  miss this doc .  he  is on the  spot , with  your problems and  pain ,Great  Doc !!!",Male
 The receptionist there is the rudest person I’ve ever met.  If she was fired he would have more clients because we literally did not go back because of her. ,Male
Good doctor but very poor office staff.,Male
"I can’t speak for the Doctor, however, after finally making an appointment I received an email containing a “New Patient Packet” that made me rethink my willingness to associate with this practice.
The first page was a request for the usual information, Name, address and insurance information. After that came four pages of “Office Rules”, none of which I’m inclined to agree to or have any bearing on the Doctor/Patient relationship. I can live with the admonition that as Dr. Cabahug is on call in",Male
"Dr. Cabahug is actually a good and reputable doctor with a lousy staff.  Every single time I  have an appointment with this doctor, someone from his office without fail always calls me a few hours before my scheduled appointment to cancel my appointment and reschedule me, only to reschedule me a month out from my original appointment.  You never get anyone when you call the office. Rhonda is really bad for his business!!! It's not because of Dr. Cabahug that I give a 1-star review...it's Rhonda.",Male
"Worst office ever. Signed in and listened to staff discuss what they were going to order for lunch for ten minutes before I was even called to the desk. They don't answer the phone and take weeks to return messages (if at all). Waiting room is so overcrowded people were waiting in their cars (no joke). Dr. Cabahug has dismissed me on two different visits, saying ""there is nothing wrong"" with me. He took guesses (""it might be your thyroid"") and recommended OTC meds. Will never go back.",Male
"When I was having aphasia, apraxia and other brain issues I went to see Dr. Cabahug. Two MRIs (both showing major problems) he announced that a B-12 deficiency was the root of all my ills and started me on B-12 shots. Dr. Cabahug has an agenda with B-12, you see it all over his office when you first walk in giving the impression he has formed a diagnosis before even seeing you. Worse, he withheld MRI results to force me into his B-12 program. Turned out I have Lewy Body Dementia and he missed it",Male
"The doctor is fine, although I'm not certain that all the tests he required were entirely necessary. However, the office staff (one in particular-don't know her name) leave something to be desired. They are rude, waste your time, and mis-manage insurance issues.",Male
It's very hard to reach anybody to schedule a appt or talk to a nurse. and have to leave messages which don't get returned!!!!,Male
The doctor himself is fantastic but if you have a problem with your bill good luck getting a hold of them or having them return your call,Male
Excellent Fine Physician,Male
Always a good experience ,Male
He is a wonderful Dr. He helped me and my husband conceive our first baby. Was sad to see he was gone from the practice since we are now trying for baby #2.,Male
"Dr. Cabala is an excellent doctor. He took excellent care of me during my pregnancy, and answered all of my questions. As I had a few pregnancy concerns he went over all possible outcomes, and was positive. I highly recommend Dr. Cabala to anyone and everyone. He also took great care of me and my child during my delivery. Also put my husband's mind at ease during the process.",Male
Always takes time to listen; appointments run pretty much on schedule which is respectful to the patient ,Male
"First time in my 56 yrs to be referred to an OB/GYN and found Dr. Cabala very friendly, answered my questions, was very informative, discussed my options and let ME decide what I wanted to do and he agreed with my decision.

When I get extremely nervous I often turn to humour to help calm myself. Dr. Cabala laughed with me and put me at ease.  For a person that has anxiety attacks that was monumental for me.  

I will continue to see him when needed.",Male
Dr.Cabala is Excellent,Male
I have been going to Dr. Cabala for over 12 years and he saw me through two healthy pregnancies and two miscarriages.  I have always found him to be kind and caring.  He always listens and spends as much time with me as needed.,Male
Simply the best .  Great manner.  Very thorough with explanations and guidance for my health care.  Wonderful.   ,Male
"Dr. Cabala has horrible bedside manner. He does not explain anything to you and talks down to you. I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt after my first visit but it is not any better. I leave his office feeling EXTREMELY frustrated and feel he doesn't care about me or my issues. When I ask questions or remind him of what he previously said, he starts arguing with you and states you are in the wrong. Would NOT recommend him to anyone! ",Male
Dr Cabala is the worst dr with the worse mannerism I have ever experienced. I would never recommend him for a dr. Totally rude.,Male
Love Dr. Cabalar! Nice to have a Physician who spends considerable time with me and who truly cares about my well being.,Female
"Fraudulent activity with my insurance.  I saw this doctor in2019 and she couldn't help me after several visits.  I went on to seek a second opinion elsewhere.  In October she calls me out of the blue and starts asking me questions.  I politely answered her questions.   Yesterday I received a bill for an ""office visit"".  I never had an office visit with this doctor in 2020.  I know money is tight during this pandemic but don't trump up a charge with my insurance company.",Female
"I am currently looking for a new rheumatologist.  All she did was read from a paper, enter my information into her computer and prescribed medicine.  She did not explain what I had, the next to treat it, things I could do to make myself more comfortable or anything.  I had to ask what type of condition, the severity and if I could have pain medication.  She shows no sign of compassion or concern for my pain.",Female
She is very thorough and professional.,Female
"-no answering service for non-office hours
-takes too many phone calls to get them to do something
-she does not return calls, even when a message indicates there is an emergency
-lacks empathy and basic human compassion for her patients",Female
"Dr. Cabaleiro, is a prison Doctor who also works @ the Osceola County Health Department in Poinciana FL.   On 07/28/2017  I went to the health department as a new patient. 1) She violated the patient bill of rights 2) She sent the wrong prescriptions to the pharmacy. When confronted she tried to cover it up.  3) She has a limited license Area of Critical Need Medical Doctor.   Be careful of this Dr.",Female
"She is a nightmare, after 3 endoscopes, capsule test and colonoscopy she passed me onto another specialist. Isn't she supposed to be a specialist. Very abrupt, doesn't fully explain anything to aging patients. Overall should not be in the Medical field. So much of my time was wasted dealing with her. Hard to get in contact with her to even have endoscopy done. Unethical and incompetent.",Female
Excellent service . The staff very professional. very recommended. ,Female
Terrible/wouldn't recommend this lady. Never returns phone calls. Had 3 appts and had to wait no less than 1 1/2 hrs. Really? She ordered a specimen for analysis and waited 13 days for a phone call with results only after going through primary Doctor. Move on. Not worth the aggravation.  Plenty of GI doctors to choose,Female

Dr Caballero takes great care of my father. The office staff and doctor are very caring and make you feel comfortable. Highly recommend Dr Caballero.,Male
"Trying to get a timely appointment is ridiculous. First, Dr. Caballero does not go to the Leesburg Regional Hospital as I thought. I just came out of the hospital and have questions about my heart medicines, which are now unclear due to changes.  The staff making appointments would not give me an appointment for three weeks plus the person was very nasty. She did not know that I was a patient although I have gone there for more than two years. She claimed I had cancelled the last 5 appointments which was not true. When you want an earlier appointment for a new problem THEY cancel a close appointment when they give you the earlier appointment. In addition, the last appointment that I had, they had electrical problems so when I got to the office I was told no one was there to see me; they would reschedule which they never did. I called twice and asked that the office manager call me and they never did. I am researching other cardiologists; what good is a cardiologist if you can't see him",Male
"After having some chest pain Dr. Caballero did a series of very through tests on me.  He fully/clearly explained the results and he always makes you feel like you can ask him anything, he never rushes your visit.",Male
"Very knowledgable, great bedside manner, excellent staff.",Male
"I would recommend Dr. Caballero to anyone.  He is the consummate professional with the education, training and experience that is very difficult to find in Florida.  He listens and explains everything in a way I can understand.  His office waiting room is comfortable and his staff is excellent.",Male
"I just don’t know. I think he knows what he’s doing. Came promptly when my fiancé passed in the ER,  I appreciate that his bedside manner.  Told me an autopsy was ordered and then left. I’m an RN and felt it was indicated, as did another Mayo MD on hand. The family was shocked that it was verbally “done” but not actually. I think I’ll call it..the jury is out. Very competent staff...in particular, Hilary.  Thanking her for her competence  and beautiful bedside manner. Office a bit cramped. ",Male
"Great doctor. Knowledgeable, personable, and excellent staff.",Male
"Worst experience with a doctor ever!  Made errors on prescription dosages, didn't know the medicines my mother was taking, very arrogant, pitted one family member against the next.  Would not return calls.  Only wanted to talk about his relationship with his parent.  AVOID!",Male
"Outstanding diagnostician. He spends as much time as necessary to discover the problem and cause, researches all variables, and spends as much time as necessary to solve the problem.",Male
Vindictive doctor that will call CPS on a parent if child spills soup on herself and was burned; then she had the audacity to give an EVIL smirk on her way out. Beware taking your child to this quack. Sad how some people can be so ugly on the inside. She must have sworn to a hypocritical oath rather than a hypocratic oath. ,Female
"Dr. Caballero was great.  He took time to explain in detail the surgery I needed.  He was
very reassuring .  Most impressed with his listening to my concerns and answering all

Highest recommendation!",Male
"I've been a patient of Dr. Caballero for almost a decade. With my rare condition, he has done an outstanding job treating me when other neurologists have not done as well. I have followed him from Alabaster to Brookwood to Tuscaloosa and back to Birmingham. I will continue to follow Dr. Caballero wherever his practice may take him!",Male
"On my first visit I found that the staff and Dr. Caballero are so compassionate in regards to patients and their needs. I have been struggling with head issues for almost a year that caused me to appear not to be in my right mind.

 I had been misdiagnosed by another doctor and decided to take matters in my own hands. Through research and divine intervention, I found Dr. C. God Bless him. He knew exactly what was wrong and did some diagnostic tests to make sure that I didn’t have a seizure or stroke and thank God I didn’t. 

I am on a treatment plan now and am back to myself. Dr. Caballero,I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for you actually listening to me and focusing on my issues. I would recommend you to everyone I know.",Male
"Doctor Caballero is caring. His billers are not. Dr.Caballero's office owes me for 3 copays I should not have been forced to pay upfront in order to be seen. No co-pay no visit It's also a copay based before Medicare adjusts the bill, so hopefully you get a refund 3 months later for your overpaid copay. Main issue: Doctors are not supposed to charge QMB patients a copay. But it's like talking to a brick wall with his billers. They contend they do not accept Medicaid, WHICH I DO NOT HAVE,The Doctor is fine, billing not knowledgeable on Medicare law.",Male
"After years of suffering from migraines, Dr Caballero was able to stop them. Thanks!!",Male
"Great bedside manner,very informative and compassionate about what he does. I have been having balance issues blurred vision headaches and falling for months without resolution., I've had various test and no  doctor ever thought to do an MRI.

He takes the time to listen and has my best interest at heart.",Male
"After my car accident Dr Caballero listened  and looked at me as a patient/person, not a chart ( and if you’ve really ever been sick, that’s what matters ) and proactively worked with me.

Very caring and a excellent cardiologist surgeon. I was lucky to have him as my surgeon for the placement of my ninth stent. Minimal pain and fast recovery. Confident in his ability to perform open heart surgery if and when I will need it. First cardiologist to make me laugh; which is a feat in itself.,Male
"Where can I find Dr Caballero? Last time I saw him was in pediatric care group, I would really like to see him again. He was a really good doctor, and I would really like him to be the pediatrician for my kids.",Male
"Dr. Caballero has been the best doctor I have come across. He is personable, takes the time to explain conditions, really cares about your child as a person and not just another patient. He goes miles to help you and to make sure your children are taken care of and healthy. We follow him wherever he goes! Excellent physician.",Male
"I absolutely love Dr Caballero!!! He has been my children's doctor since birth and I really love his attention to detail and how thorough he is with his patients. I followed him from PCG to Carcamo Peds and although I live in Apopka, I make the drive to see him no matter what :) ",Male
Dr. Caballero has been my children's doctor for over eight years. I absolutely love the way he treats them and how he takes his time to listen to my concerns and explain his reasoning. I disliked the office he used to work for in Lake Underhill. The waiting time was over 3 hours and the staff was never helpful. I kept going because I really liked Dr. Caballero. Now that he moved to Dr. Carcamos ofe I am extremely happy. I am very satisfied with the new place and the staff.,Male

",Male
"











Dr. Caballero is a wonderful doctor who has bedside manners and is caring, and kind. He is also experienced in many areas. It is nice to get an adjustment from my Medical Doctor. He is also a team player. He is part of a team of Doctors that are treating a family members depression. We have a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and Dr. Caballero as part of a successful team and treatment plan. We would recommend his services very much.!",Male
I have been a patient of Dr. Caballero for about 5 years now. He is by far the best Doictor I've ever had. I drive for over an hour to see him. The practice that he is a part of has a office that I could get to in about 15 mins. It is worth the drive for me to see Dr. Caballero.,Male
"Dr. Caballero is most certainly the best doctor I've had.  He is very thorough and spends decent amounts of time with his patients.  He has a sense of humour but is also quite professional, and has spent more time than any other doctor in trying to find the source of my medical problems.  The office almost always has a long wait, but as a doctor, he is wonderful.",Male
"Had an appointment today with Dr Caballero ,I have been sick for weeks -A MONTH AGO THEY REFUSED TO SEE ME BECAUSE I OWED $136.00 I Have ins but still owed  $136.00, I FINALLY CAME UP WITH $100.00 PLUS A COPAY and figured and they let me slide for a while on a lousy $36 bucks but No,they refused to see me AND she ASKED IF i WOULD LIKE TO RESCHEDULE WHEN i HAVE MORE MONEY,I said I am sick today and she said sorry...... I think Dr Cab is good but only as good as his staff",Male
"While my experience with Dr. Caballero was pleasant it certainly lacked professionalism.  After a 1.5 hour wait in the lobby I felt nearly accosted by the medical assistant and was told they would not perform a physical for new patients - the primary reason I was there. 30 minutes later I saw Dr. Caballero and was generally pleased with the interaction.  He was thorough and very easy to talk to, however he did answer a personal call during the exam and twice people barged into the room.",Male
"I was seen by De Caballero Oct of 2016 for blood work for my hyperthyroidism. I've been waiting for a month to get my script for new medication, that gets changed every month, and he has yet to write a new script for me.  I am now out of my medication that I desperately have to have. He and his office refuses to return my call as well as give me what I need. When I was seen in Oct, he told me to wait another month and come back. Clearly, he has no regards for my condition.",Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. Caballero's for five years. He is awesome! Very caring and compassionate doctor who does all he can for his patients. He is well educated, and shares his knowledge with his patients. A sunny disposition and excellent bedside manner that makes you feel at ease. There is no other Doctor I would want for my family or myself.  If you are reading this tryouts no to decide if Dr. Cab is right for you, I tell you that you cannot go wrong.  **********************************",Male
"Dr Caballero is a definition of true caring professional in medicine. Very detail in explaining your health care needs,",Male
Dr. Caballero loves his patients he not only takes care of the children but the parents too. We loved him when he was with Dr Judge and transfered with in his private practice.,Male
"Dr. Caballero was my pediatrician in AL. When my family was stationed at Ft. McClellan. He was always great with all 6 of us &amp; listened to my mom's concerns. Dr. C is an amazing doctor with a gently, caring &amp; sincere bedside manner. We loved him so much we faked being sick! The PEMBERTON BUNCH!",Male
"Absolutely love him for too many reasons to list but I will try.

1) He listens to me as the mother. He  has said to me before that mother's intuition is better than any medical degree
2) He has called me after hours before to check on my baby
3) He prays for my baby
4) He isn't quick to throw a prescription pad at the issue with out thoroughly examining my child. 
5) He remembers me and my children. We aren't just another name on a chart.

In Conclusion: Doctor C please don't ever retire!",Male
"My experience was awful. First of all, the referral was done months ago (understanding pandemic) and yet, after we receive the reminder call to bring insurance cards Etc we were received very poorly-the receptionist could not find the referral, and although we have Aetna insurance we were told did not accept our insurance after waiting close to 45 minutes. I am sure Dr Caballero can do better- we were very disappointment specially when the visit was about my 17 year old daughter- They seem they didn't care.",Male

"Love this doctor and this practice! My whole family uses this dermatologist - acne, skin cancer checks, rashes, you name it. They listen and care. Busy office because they are good. Worth the wait!",Male
"i was recently charged $50 for a missed appointment.   When I called the office for an explanation, I was told in a condescending fashion, to paraphrase:  ""The appointment was made a year ago.  We made a courtesy call to remind you.  Still, it is your responsibility to keep your track of your appointments.""  I can overlook rudeness, but not arrogance.  How can you be so intolerant of patients who are late or miss one appointment and, without blinking an eye, expect them to wait for you?",Male
"Patient care/customer serv. leaves a great deal to be desired. Been going there nearly 8 years &amp; had an appoint. last week that was not a routine visit. Have a skin issue that needs to be looked at ASAP. Takes me over an hour to drive the 50+ miles to get there. Upon arrival I was told to show my ID, insurance and Medicare cards. Had my supplemental insurance card, had only a copy of Med. card with last 4 digits cut out. Staff in ALL doc offices have access to Med site. WAS DENIED BEING SEEN.",Male
Fantastic physician! Incredibly insightful and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!,Female

His office manager, Nataly, is hardworking and nice, she gets the job done.",Male
I was treated by Dr. Caballero in Hondo Tx.  I have sever Panic &amp; Anxiety attacks &amp; Disorders along with sever depression. I was being treated by another Dr. before Dr. Caballero came on the scene. I will not mention this doctors name but she had me taking all kinds of meds that were doing me more harm than good. Dr. Caballero is a superb and caring Doctor. She listened to me and showed real compassion and got me the right kind of meds to help me cope with life and my disabilities. I give her A+,Female
"I really liked Doc Ramon's interest in my health.  He explained to me clearly how he was going to treat me.  Also, all his office staff were very friendly and always answered by questions thoroughly.",Male
"Dr. Caballero is extremely competent.  I spent well over a year with another Doctor who kept doing procedures on my kidney that were not helping but hurting the kidney.  I saw Dr. Caballero and he read the paper work and checked me over.  I had day surgery within two days.  He knew right away the problem I was having.   The problem was taken care of and my life improved.   
I tell everyone to see him.",Male

Dr Caballes and his staff were all thorough and professional. The examination was organized and very quick but not in a way of rushed but more in the way of no waiting for long periods for the next step of my visit.

"Dr. Caballes explains everything about the procedure, answers all your questions, and puts you at ease during your procedure. I highly recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Cabelles is a phenomenal doctor.  I have never felt rushed in his office; he takes the time to listen, evaluate thoroughly, and explain the best treatment options.

Polite and highly professional.,Male
Dr. Caballas has a wonderful bedside manner!,Male
Went to Dr. Caballes for a calcified tendon in my shoulder that we had not been able to resolve with physical therapy. He was able to diagnose the severity of the calcification right off using an ultrasound on my first visit. We then scheduled a procedure to hopefully get it taken care of which would break it up so we can start to get the mobility back. I have just had that procedure done and it was relatively painless. I was able to watch everything that he was doing on the ultrasound screen as it was being done - fascinating.  So far so good and it appears promising!,Male
Dr. Caballes was so knowledgable and great.  My procedure was quick and something about him kept me calm and with trustful feeling.  Thank you for helping me move forward and getting back to my activities I enjoy so much.,Male

"Excellent physician, he has been my family's doctor for 15 years. We have followed him from one clinic to another. He takes time to listen to concerns and run necessary tests as well as give speedy referrals to specialists when needed. He has a lot of patients and moves quickly, but when you let him know you have questions about anything, he will sit, listen, and answer any questions you may have.",Male
When I brought my mother up to live in New Jersey from Florida Dr Caballes became her primary doctor. I have since been amazed at the level of care and compassion he has shown in treating my mom.

He knows his business and I trust and rely on his expertise and advice. ,Male

As a physician myself, I could tell he truly cared for his patients with sincerity and real compassion.",Male

"He is wonderful.  I have severe foot problems and have been to 3 other podiatrists.  Dr. Caballes is the best.  He is kind and caring and explains your foot problem so you understand it.  I am in pain most of the time with my feet and he has helped with pads, numbing cream, and shots.  I have a circulation problem so he cannot operate, even if I needed it.  My left foot is extremely bad, but other than pads, orthotics etc., nothing can be done.
If you need a podiatrist, I recommend Dr. Caballes.",Male

"I have had great experiences with Adam. He has a nice bedside manner and I believe he knows what he's doing regarding my 2 back surgeries. He listens to my concerns and answers my questions.

"I have Lupus which an Immune system disease. I am susceptible to migraines w all day vomiting and viral infections, thus making me sick quite often. This doctor did not appear to know much about Lupus at all. Also, when I showed him the medicine I was taking, he insisted it was blood pressure medicine.

A very unprofessional approach and I have no positive expectations that a medical verdict will be given any where in my favor.",Male

Dr. Cuban and his staff  listened to my son and with no hesitation completed the forms in a timely manner. 

Dr. Caban is a skilled surgeon and the staff is an integral part of making 
every detail flow smoothly.  I am thankful that they understand the importance of helping families in their times of need. Having this form done decently and in order was a true family stress release.

3 weeks after surgery and my wife can't even hold down liquids. Tried discussing with the dr to see what's going. Dr just brushed us off and said my wife needed pain management saying she was a drug addict when she hasn't been able to take her pain meds.

"Dr. Caban was awesome! Took the time to explain everything to me, and was very helpful and sympathetic about my struggles with endometriosis and conceiving. I would recommend her to anyone, in fact a few of my friends have switched to her from other doctors and love her!",Female
"Dr. Caban was very courteous, professional and thorough in her examination and history taking during my first visit with her. She offered testing options and explained everything in terms I could understand. I would definitely recommend her. ",Female
"I had a very terrible experience delivering with this doctor. She didn't listen to me, ignored my birth plan, and made inappropriate comments throughout delivery and after. I was traumatized by my experience with her and am lucky to have recovered physically. I will have to switch practices, even though I liked most of the other doctors in this practice, because I cannot risk being seen or delivered by her again.",Female
"We have been going to Dr. Caban for two years now. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my kids. He has a nice clean facility, with a staff that truly cares about the welfare of your children. 
One of our babies was sick during cold/flu season last year. I called Dr. Caban's number (after normal business hours) and left a voicemail with my son's current symptoms. He called me back within five minutes and gave me advice on what to do. That was the fasted I had ever heard back from a medical provider before and I truly appreciated his prompt response. 
Thank you for everything Dr. Caban and family, you guys are a blessing!",Male
He is very friendly and speaks Spanish too so he explained everything in Spanish. I love the environment. ,Male
Seriously in cameron this is the only doctors place id even take my child,Male
"Dr.  Caban takes the time to explain the patient the results of analysis and the condition in a way that makes medicine sound ""patient friendly"".  He is very knowledgeable and methodic.  But even better is that he takes a hollystic approach to the treatments recommended.  Patients are human beings with physical and spiritual needs.  He is a 10!",Male
"I would not recommend Dr. Caban. The other doctors in the practice were unavailable and now I understand why she was. I considered changing to this practice but going to her made me realize how much I love my other practice, despite it being far from my new home. Her bedside manner was awful and she dropped several f-bombs. As someone younger I wasn't offended, but it's really poor professional practice. She wasn't willing to help me and didn't seem to listen to my concerns. I'm not sure where all of the great reviews came from but my experience was less than stellar.",Female
"Dr. Caban has poor bedside manner. I agree with the other review that she is not very warm. She doesn't explain the necessity for the testing that she is doing nor does she explain the results of your ultrasounds. In my first appointment with her, she used the f-word several times, which I found to be unprofessional. She also expressed how she thought parents who didn't want the gender on their baby's birth certificate was ""messed up and that the world has gone crazy.""",Female
"I had a very good experience with Dr. Caban. I thought that her patient teaching was great. She left the computer outside and had full attention on me. She was compassionate and had a great bedside manner. Today, I had a procedure in the hospital by Dr. Caban . Once again, I found her to be sweet, concerned and knowledgeable.  I would recommend her??",Female
I would not recommend. She was not very warm not did she talk to me about the tests she was doing. One she did at the last minute that I didn't even need because she didn't want to wait for my old office to send the records and didn't give me the option of saying no. I didn't even find out about two tests until after I switched practices and received the bill. ,Female
Excelente servicio y atenci?n.,Female
I was recommend by someone and I am really happy with his service. I would recommend Dr. Cabanas to family and friends.  ,Male
"NEW patients strictly limited to 15minits &amp; 2 ailments, no time to even go over recent health history; Front desk REPEATEDLY insisted I needed no referral, though I certainly did; made appointments that were not scheduled when i arrived w/appointment reminder in hand; Wrong &amp; different prescript amounts ordered 3months in a row!! The doc is nice, but even with a recent 830am appointment, didn't see me until 940am. Tried using this office for a year+. Don't walk away, RUN!",Male
"I have already recommended people to Dr. Cabanas.  He is the most charismatic professional doctor I've ever met.  He has a genuine concern for his patients.  My mother and father have received impeccable service from his office staff and since my parents speak Spanish, the staff and Dr Cabanas spoke in my parent's native language.  My parents felt empowered and informed in addressing their health issues.

",Male
I would recommed Dr Cabanas to family and friends!!,Male
"Dr. Jennine Cabanellas is the worst, most unprofessional ophthalmologist you would ever see in your entire life. Horrible attitude, zero knowledge of the issues, no respect for patient's health and well being. Who gave her the license to practice?
AVOID THIS DOCTOR - OPTHALMOLOGIST  JUST LIKE YOU WILL AVOID THE EBOLA VIRUS.",Female
"She is Amazing, I have never felt younger thanks to her, Doctor Cabanellas is one in a million that I can guarantee. 10/10",Female

Hola mi nombre es María vega fui paciente del doctor latony por muchos años favor de de volverme la llamada al 610 588 8959 si no contesto es pk estoy trabajando déjame saber a que hora me puedo comunicar gracias,Male
Absolutely fantastic experience with Dr. Cabanilla. I would recommend any of my family or friends to him. Very personable and did a great job of explaining the surgery to us. Excellent follow up and his level of experience and willingness to consult colleagues for difficult cases is much appreciated. He kept our cost needs in the decision process and this willingness to put the patient needs first has won our respect!,Male
This doctor is clearly illiterate and doesn't bother to inform himself of patient cases. ,Male
"I had a pinched radial nerve from neck to elbow. Couldnt lift my arm. He walked in and grabbed my arm and yanked up over my head..i was screaming grabbing my arm with my other hand, bawling and begging him to let go. They sedated me and i was in er for hours when i was told they were waiting on blood labs. I asked what the labs were for. They said they had to do a pregnancy test. I looked at the nurse and said,""I specifically told the woman at intake I'd had a hystetectomy"".  It took me 8 months to recover from something that would otherwise been healed up in a few weeks. Grabbing my arm and jerking it up AFTER I TOLD him I'd pinched my radial nerve was negligent and wreckless.  I do not recommend him. It was torture and I texted my son and others to memorialize what was happening to me. There would be a negative star here if that was an option.",Male
"I went to ER for hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding. This dr did an extremely ROUGH rectal exam. Poor bedside manor and left me crying and in more pain than i was originally in. NEVER AGAIN. If you or a loved one if in ER - if you see this dr. coming to help you, ask for a different doctor!",Male
He is an excellent oncology and a passionate person for his work and to help people in the cure for the cancer. He saved my life in 2004 when I was with lymphoma.,Male
Find anyone else. One of the most systematic non empathetic doctors I’ve encountered.,Female
"Dr. Cabanillas has been the lead on my team at MDA for nearly 3 years. The level of care I've received from her and for that matter everyone else at MDANDERSON has been highly commendable. While everyone's situation is different, there is nowhere else I'd choose for my Anaplastic thyroid cancer treatments.",Female
"Then don’t try Dr Julie Johnson at Moffitt that is exactly what she did. She stated she was having my slides re-read my chief pathologist and then doesn’t remember the conversation. She also ordered blood test and had a 20 min conversation about it with me, not only were there no orders in the lab there wasn’t dictation in her notes. I changed drs and now my other Drs at Moffitt are referring me out like I’ve been black balled at the whole facility. And I am a high risk patient.",Female
"I strongly encourage anyone that unfortunately is diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer to reconsider and even request a physician change if you are unfortunately assigned to Dr. Maria Cabanillas.  She is not considerate or demonstrate any type of reasonable bedside manner or decorum.  She literally lied to my face and my wifes face saying she never suggested specific treatment.  I will spare everyone the drama but I will say that if you want care, you will not receive it from Dr. Maria Cabanillas.",Female
"Dr. Cabanillas is the worst cancer care doctor I have encountered.  On my initial visits with her she refused to follow-up in depth to my primary care physicians concerns, and instead overrode his protocol for future imaging and disease tracking.  After 5 years of her prohibiting me from getting definitive scans, I now face larger health issues.  She denies having ever given me this instruction, though she did consistently.  If you want serious attention for your cancer, please run from MDA.",Female
"I've only had one appointment with Dr. Cabaniss (which was performed online) but so far I am much more satisfied with him than either of my two previous neurologists.  Dr. Cabaniss asked many questions about my symptoms and listed patiently to my answers.  Afterwards he explained my condition very thoroughly, presented me with several treatment options, and explained the pros and cons of each.  Based on his advice I will be changing medications.  Time will tell how effective the new medication is, but I feel much more confident in this treatment plan than in my previous one.",Male
He’s saves lives!,Male
"AND now that there is a shelter-in-place order, the doctor's office is providing virtual visits. thank you.",Female
Dr. Cabansag really listens to her patients and never makes you feel rushed during the appointment.,Female
I searched for a long time for a doctor I felt comfortable with and who I felt I could trust. I don't want to have procedures that I don't need and I want things explained to me in a way that I can understand. I found all this and more with Dr. Cabansag. I am happy with her and don't need to go anywhere else. I feel fortunate to have found San Francisco Gastroenterology. ,Female
"Dr. Cabansag is an outstanding doctor.  She is very knowledgeable, listens well, engages you with good questions, is very helpful, skilled and proactive in her approach.  She always exceeds my expectations because she is thorough and never rushed.  I always feel I have her complete attention.  I highly recommend her to others.",Female
"Dr. Cabansag is great! I feel super comfortable with her and she is very knowledgeable ! However her office staff is pretty disappointing, I've been waiting 2 weeks for them to call in my new medication. I have even called them to follow up and it still has not been done. Ernie who deals with scheduling is the best employee they have there.",Female
"Dr. Cabasag is a really excellent Dr.  She is kind, considerate and has a sense of humor that helps make any gastro procedure not so bad!  I was lucky to have her as a Dr. for my two-part procedure as I was very nervous and concerned about all of it.  She put my mind at ease and it made a huge difference for me.  

Plus, her office staff are wonderful, too!",Female
"Dr. Cabansag really listens to what I say and responds . She is an excellent doctor.  She asks questions to further her understanding. She does not rush, and she spends lots of time with each patient.  I wish all my doctors were like her. ",Female
"Dr. Cabansag is always 100% upfront with you when it comes to your health. She delivered all of my children and continued care for me for over 21 years. From the beginning, she let me know if I were to be her patient, I had to follow her instructions to insure safe delivery of each child and a healthy recovery for myself. She cares for every patient as if you were her own daughter, mother or sister. She gives you upmost respect and confidence. I recommend her to anyone and everyone I know.",Female
"I recently had the worst experience also with Dr. Cabansag. She spent 5 minutes with me for one concern(she was running 30minutes late)and didn't address the cause of the concern. I had one more question for her and was told I would have to make another appointment for this. She was insensitive and rude and was in a hurry to get out of the room(It was lunch time!) I also have had her deny prescriptions I have been on for years for no reason,",Female
"Pay careful attention to the reviews posted on this website.  One negative would be an anomaly and possibly overlooked.  But look how many unhappy patients there are.  Count me in that category.  She is the worst provider I have ever seen.  She is rude, and has not interest in answering questions with more than short snarky replies.    ",Female
"Terrible!! She refused to prescribe a much needed blood pressure medication for my husband (who had been on that med. for 20 years) unless he agreed to unnecessary procedures first. On one visit, my husband told her he had a new mole that he was concerned about.  She said, ""That will happen when you get older.""  SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE 5 SEC. TO LOOK AT IT!  When my husband got extremely ill from his high blood pressure, we had enough!  Found another Dr. that got him on his meds. the same day!",Female
"I receive very good care. Has been proactive with decisions, and I feel so much better.",Female
Horrible!!!!!!! She has no compassion and should not be in this field. Worst experience I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!,Female
I have been going to Dr Cabansag for over 5 years. Not sure why there is so many negative reviews because I’ve had a pleasant experience with her. Kind of a bummer that others had worse experiences. I’ve went to an annual physical with her every year and she does a thorough exam plus all bloodwork. She follows up with a phone call and notes in my spectrum health website with possible solutions to issues I should address. I can always get in a timely manner if I’m emergency sick also.,Female
Terrible doctor! DO NOT go to her! She is so rude and does not care about her patients. She is the most judgmental and rude doctor I have ever gone to. She honestly shouldn't have her medical license. I will never go to her or her office ever again!!! 0 STARS!,Female
"i have never been treated so horribly by a doctor in all of my 53 years! had to see her as my doctor was not available for a throat culture and i was terribly ill with some scary virus. took all i could to get the office, but Dr. Cabansag refused to give me a throat culture! i have been ill 25 yrs. she finally angrily did and guess what?! she never sent it on to the lab, and i was called to retake it. look further for bad reviews about her; she should not be licensed.",Female

"She was the worst doctor I've ever gone to. She acts very judgemental and assumes the worst--and shares that with you. She's rude,short, unprofessional and rushes you out of the office. I switched doctors and I am sooo much happier and I don't have a panic attack everytime I need to go see a doctor",Female
"I would not reccomend her as your PCP.. if I told her about an issue I had she was very insensitive and didn't care about what I said. She is terrible! She rushed me almost every time I had an appointment with her. I've only
Ever had a couple appointments with her and I wasn't impressed at all. I changed PCP's and I couldn't be more happier. DONT GO TO HER. She accepts everyone and anyone, and takes care of NO ONE! 0 out of 5 stars for sure.",Female
Very caring. Very nice. Good listener. ,Female
"Sharon is a joke to the medical community! She should never be referred to as Dr. That is reserved for doctors who understand and accept their role as healers. Sharon is NOT any of those things! Your role as a doctor healthcare professional, is to HELP, LISTEN, apply ALL your knowledge to helping heal people. Once upon a time you cared, but somewhere you lost your way, I pray you pull your BIG HEAD out of your backside sooner than later! ",Female
She is always in a hurry. Doesn't care about her patients. She doesnt listened to everything I say and leaves too fast to ask her or mention anything else that concerns me.

Dr Cabaret was caring and understood the pain issues I was having. Even though most of our contact was via ZOOM he was able to accurately diagnose my problem. I was especially impressed by the fact that he exhausts conservative measures first - does not jump to the most aggressive treatment .

Took a 101 yr old patient to see this doctor n waited an hour just to see him. This man has no bedside manner whatsoever. Had me leave room n heard him raise his voice n then opened the door n said I was going to do a test on him but he almost fell down so I won’t be doing the test today but I can guarantee that this man will be billed for it anyway. I don’t find this doctor professional in any way. This patient should not have been tested at 101 to begin with! True professionals r telling me to bring h up on charges however I chose to never bring this poor man to this incompetent doctor ever again. It’s scary knowing that he is still in practice. Shame on Dr Peter DAddario,Male
Went there for appt. waited in line for 15 minutes while the receptionist signed out a patient. By the time I got to the window she told me I was late and could not be seen. However I was not late and said it was not my fault that it took her 15 minutes to check out the patient and she said it was not her fault either that it took so long. She also stated the doc was no longer in the building so with my blood boiling I wondered how much time he had for me anyway. I will go elsewhere.,Male

TWICE  confirmed apt time, show up and told it was a different time and have to reschedule. Going somewhere els!",Male
"Dr. D'Addario is a kind, caring man, and a knowledgeable , caring physician. During an insurance change he was not covered under my plan, leaving me no other choice but to seek help elsewhere.

He genuinely tries his best to offer every possible solution for his patient’s convenience. I highly recommend him if you’re looking for a caring doctor that is trustworthy.",Male
"If would  keep his mouth shut and do the job that he’s being paid for, I probably still wouldn’t recommend him.",Male
"Excellent experience. Though the office was running behind, I didn’t mind. Sometimes things just happen. Very personable, explained procedure thoroughly &amp; didn’t seem to be rushed at all. Totally gave the impression that he truly cares about his patients.  Even called me that evening to check on me. Would recommend him a 10000000%",Male
Dr. D’Addario did a fantastic job taking skin cancer off my husband. He was very personable and kind as well as being an excellent dermatologist.,Male
"And excellent, enjoyable experience! Can't wait for the next cancer to pot up so I can come back.",Male
he is very good at his profession,Male
great,Male
Steve and his angels are the best:),Male
everything was great. wonderful staff,Male
Shauna and Dr. D'Addario were great,Male
Love this office,Female
very good experience,Male
"His assistant was great,pleasant",Male
great result,Male
awesome,Male
This doctor was far more interested in being humorous than doing his job properly. He left me with a large scar that became infected and as a result all my hair around the scar fell out and never grew back. Worst experience of my life. ,Male
"Entire staff is great. Follow-up is fabulous, even after office was already closed for the day (on a Fri). This was greatly appreciated. The staff not only makes you healthy but discusses the best options for you to stay healthy.",Male
"Great doctor and staff, sits and really listens to your issues, treats patients with respect.",Male
"First of all....she is aging in the reverse as on first sight, I thought her too young to be my daughter's doctor.  I was impressed by Dr. D'Addese's breath of knowledge; converting medical jargon into layman's terms; and her successful attempt at bonding with my daughter.  

She is further supported by an amazing office team.  They were professional and personable.  After a few minutes, my daughter was happily interacting and exploring the office due to how comfortable she was made to feel.  

A doctor's visit - no matter how routine or complexed the situation, is rarely where one wants to be; but I feel encouraged to know that I get competence and heart from Dr. D'Addese and her team, and I’m sure you will as well.",Female
"My husband and I both saw Dr.DAddesi and we were both very satisfied with him.  In fact my husband had to have an operation on his carotid artery with another doctor and while he was in the recovery room, Dr. DAddesoi went in to see him. Number one with us.",Male
He is the best .,Male
"Caring, down to earth, and able to diagnose &amp; treat difficult muscular and tendon issues.  ",Male
"Excellent, compassionate doctor. Explains all options in detail. ",Male
"Saw the doctor in October concerning hand surgery , wife also went on last visit before surgery in November. I previously had told her the doctor mistakenly identified the wrong digit twice. Same thing happened again .My wife urged me to see another Dr. but was in to much pain to wait. should have listened to her. He got digit right during surgery but now have limited use of digit, had full dexterity before surgery just no strength after a certain point. Always get second opinion, please!",Male
I agree Dr. D'Addesi is a wonderful doctor.  I had a serious arm and wrist injury and I am so grateful to him for putting me back together.  ,Male
"Dr D'Adessi, first, is a outstanding surgeon, second, will make you very comfortable about any operation he will be performing &amp; third, he's just a great guy.
After a serious automobile accident, it was my good fortune that I became a patient of Dr. D'Adessi.
I only attended the Exeter office, the staff there is wonderful, the relaxed professional atmosphere made me very comfortable. 5 ?????????? to all.
I would highly recommend Dr D'Adessi to everyone.",Male
"This is my 2nd review...Dr. D'Addesi has a wonderful mannerism, makes you feel very comfortable.The staff, the assistants and nurses are very friendly, professional and knowledgeable...This time I needed surgery for my trigger finger, as the injections no longer worked.My appointment was scheduled within 2 weeks, my surgery scheduled in 3 weeks...Surgery went very well...Never waited more than 10 minutes for office visits and therapy...Would highly recommend Dr. D'Addesi...",Male
"First time at office, was taken within 10 minutes of arrival.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about procedures. Had injection in hand - painful, but Dr. D'Addessi made it as. Easy as possible.   Would recommend him.",Male
Nothing against the Doctor himself but I cannot recommend the office as wait times were ridiculous to say the least. I had to wait 3 hrs one time and never ever under one hour past my appointed time.,Male
The entire staff at VIVA are really excellent. They are friendly and professional. I had two surgeries by Dr. D'Addio and they were both very successful. The concern about pain and the follow-up was exceptional. This is a very good practice and I would recommend it highly.,Male
"Many doctors appear too busy to give detailed explanations to patients, and even when they do, the doctor-ease may be over the patient's head.  Not so with Dr. D'Addio.  He surpasses any physician I have encountered in 20 years of working with doctors in my job as an attorney helping injured people.",Male
"Where to start? Maybe if he stayed off Facebook he'd take care of his patients better. Can never get appointment or speak to anyone even in emergency,  because your chronically on hold and then disconnected. Partners don't communicate with each other. Results are never reviewed or explained. Drs rush you out of office. They never give alternatives to treatments when side effects experienced.Staff is rude and most have no knowledge of cardiovascular terms,, drugs and possible complications that can arise when talking to patients in need. As a healthcare professional I have never experienced such disregard of patient care. I have seen 4 of the physicians in this practice in office and hospital and after months of trying to get proper care and follow i have been forced to find another physician that actually care about doing the right thing. Had I been treated properly early when ill a hospital admission and subsequent invasive procedure could have been avoided",Male
I am sorry to see that others had similar negative experiences with Dr. D’Agate.  He is arrogant and hesitant to adequately explain unfamiliar terms.  He apparently developed a heart related YouTube channel that he pushed during the appointments.  That was not what we wanted in a doctor.,Male
"One of the best Dr's I have, if not the best, very caring, and he takes his time explaining things to you in a way that you can fully understand. I have highly recommended him to friends.",Male
This guy is arrogant He barely stayed in the room for a minute. He was rushing around and getting people in and out of there so fast he had sweat beads above his lip. He asked me to call my Dr for a report he should have had then tells me how he doesn’t have time for this. The man is just running a factory to get as many in and out as he can to make a buck  His bedside manner is garbage. Don’t bother asking him a question because he is a condescending tool,Male
"Dr. Dagate is fantastic. He takes the time to listen to you, he is open to both traditional and holistic approaches for care, he is very proactive in his diagnostic choices, and genuinely cares about his patients. I would highly recommend Dr. D.",Male
"I was in terrible pain and scheduled for a total hip replacement.  I didn't even know if I could get on a table for the pre-surgical testing.  Dr. D'Agate expedited and condensed the  pre-surgical testing and, as a result, I was able to have the hip replacement 3 weeks earlier.   He saved me 3 additional weeks of unnecessary pain.  I thank him for listening.",Male
"Although Dr. D'Agate is knowledgeable, his staff is very rude and arrogant at both his bayshore and smithtown offices.  If you can tolerate such arrogance then I would say go to Dr. D'agate.  If not, then run for this hills.",Male
Dr. Really needs to clean up his act dealing with his patients.  Found him to be very unprofessional.,Male
"I don't know if he doesn't want to explain any testing if he feels its a waste of his valuable time, but I went through three weeks of testing and he wouldn't explain any of the results to me.He spent a few minutes each appointment time and didn't speak to me and abruptly walks out ,telling me to make another appointment. I have not returned,and think he needs to improve his people skills.",Male
"Being a patient of Dr. D’Agate for several years I have found him to be a knowledgeable, professional, caring and excellent Cardiologist. Always has my best interest at heart. He is the greatest!!!",Male
"This Dr. was quite personable at my first appointment, but became arrogant and insulting when I asked a clarifying question when I returned to receive test results. He also wanted an unnecessary test and based all of his feedback to me on a test that is of questionable value, according to the most recent clinical research. This guy’s ego gets in the way of appropriate care. ",Male
Seems to be thoroughly knowledgeable but respectful of patient history and desires when prescribing plan of care.  Kindly coercive!! I am agreeing to necessary procedures I swore to never undergo again.  Cardiac care is not an option so choose carefully and don't fear moving on if first doctor seems to be not right for you. You will most likely be happy if you choose this practice.,Male
"Dr. D'Agate is wonderful. He has a great bedside manner. He is thorough and attentive and is truly concerned about his patients.  I believe and trust in his care for me. I can truly say, I trust him with my heart.",Male
"Dr. D'Agate is excellent in patient care. Very understanding and answers all of your questions. He takes time with you, which is always appreciated.",Male
"He is very professional and a very good Cardiologist.  His staff is very efficient, courteous and patient.",Male
"Dr. D'Agate is extremely professional yet warm and friendly. He greets his patients with a smile that immediately puts one at ease.
His credentials speaks volumes. 
I trust him with my heart.",Male
"My husband and I have been treated by Dr. D'agate for several years, and we both have a high level of confidence that he is the reason that we are in such good health at the ages of 77.  He administers the tests that we need and watches over us by providing us with very good advice.  We also think highly of how he welcomes us with his smile and truly cares,  giving us the time and answers any questions we have.",Male
Dr. D’Agate is a compassionate cardiologist who always makes me feel comfortable and well informed. He is always willing to take the time to answer our questions and makes sure we understand his answers.,Male
"Best Cardiologist I've seen in years.  He is caring, professional and answers all questions.

He reviews test results, explains the outcome, discusses next steps in health care, follow-up's and schedules next appointments.

I rest much easier knowing that Dr. D'Agate is watching over my heart health!",Male
"I see a cardiologist due to a family medical  history that requires careful monitoring. Dr. D'Agate is through and covers all bases with respect to diet, exercise, testing, blood work, and examination. He explains things well and looks out for the patient. The office is usually busy, but it's run very efficiently. There are a lot of ""moving parts"" with respect to check in, billing &amp; insurance, vitals, testing, examination, and check-out, but the staff works seamless like a well-oiled machine.",Male
Very intelligent and attentive. An excellent psychiatrist,Male
This man shouldn't be allowed to practice medicine. He totally botched my Achilles surgery and I've been suffering ever since. Plus a terrible attitude. Don't let him do surgery on you!,Male
"Dr D’Agostini performed total hip via posterior entry.  No pain, no complications, no stitches, no staples, no physical therapy.  Didn’t need any pain medication !  My hip had worn down 1.5” of bone length and he restored me to within a millimeter of leg length. I was on my feet next day walking with crutches less than 2 weeks, light cane for a few weeks. I have fully healed and my cells have accepted the artificial hip completely.  If you want someone to hold your hand and coddle you find another surgeon, I just wanted a great hip and having someone who would push me to get back to an active lifestyle; not hold my hand. No physical therapy needed, I followed his exercise routine at home. A year later I can play golf, run, and I can cycle 20 miles at a clip...I can honestly say it was life changing, and a year later I can’t even tell I’ve had a complete joint replacement it feels very much a part of me.",Male
"He did a total knee replacement for me almost 3 years ago. It was never right and it took nearly two years to get the pain to a level that I can live with, but I am never pain free.  I used to be very active - cycling, skiing, and now the only activity I can do is walk. The prosthesis is loose and any other activity causes swelling and pain.  I had bleeding in the knee for at lease 1.5 yrs. after surgery.  I knew I had problems at 9 weeks after surgery.  He was rude, un-sympathetic, and not interested in finding the cause or a solution.  I have medical training, which he didn't know, and he had the audacity to dismiss me, as a naive woman, by saying "" don't ask questions about things you know nothing about"".  I would recommend finding a different orthopedic surgeon.",Male
"Fantastic. I had a total Hip replacement in early December 2019. His confidence and interaction pre op was most appreciated. He is direct, concise and thorough. Everything one wants from their surgeon. When you met with him LISTEN. He will answers most if not all of your questions if you let him finsh his explanation. His office team, surgery team and the nursing staff @ Morristown Medical were all equally fantastic. If one wants something cute and cuddly go get a puppy. If you want a professional who brings his best and will fix your medical problem I highly recommend Dr. D'Agostino. In fact, I have to a dear friend!",Male
"I work in the healthcare industry and Dr. D'Agostini has one of the best reputations as an Orthopedic Surgeon in the area. He did a total hip replacement on me in 2018 and I have had an absolutely tremendous result. I don't even know it is there. He has done knee surgeries on two family members with excellent results. If you are looking for a highly qualified and excellent Orthopedic Technician and Surgeon, I would recommend Dr. D'Agostini.",Male
"Completely dismissed me. Told him I had an injury after treating me for tendinitis. Completely dismissed me with a prescription and told me to wait 4 months and then see a surgeon. Turns out, after 1 month i sought another opinion, &amp;  my bone was out of place and a ligament was torn, and ended up having surgery. I specifically asked if he thought I needed an MRI and he said no while walking out the door, not even standing for a minute to pay attention while I was asking a serious question. If you don’t have symptoms of anything specifically showing bone fracture/break - don’t waste your time, he’ll have you waiting too long to seek a second opinion if you follow his advice &amp; tell you to rest - which for many of us in the workforce, we are unable to do waiting for an injury that won’t resolve.",Male
"He replaced my hip 2 years ago. The surgery was expertly done and I was walking without a cane in 21 days. I have had no issues since then. He has a ""direct"" manner which some may consider brusque. I don't, I appreciate his no-nonsense approach. Bottom line: the nurses in the recovery room said he was the best in the hospital at what he does.",Male
My experience with Dr. D'Agostini     was okay   and great.  His bedside manner was not good ....but all his explanations and advice were excellent. The final result was excellent. I had a torn rotator cuff.....it has healed perfectly and had no pain after 4 months while  friends who used other  doctors   who were not arrogant had pain for  11/2    to 2 years. Do not    worry about his bad bedside manners but rather the final excellent results.,Male
Very clear and concise explanation. Excellent communication skills.,Male
Amazing results in a difficult surgery.  Repaired 3 severed tendons.,Male
"Dr. D’Agostini is rude and screams at his patients.  He doesn’t listen and dismisses all comments.  After a shoulder replacement,  I knew it wasn’t right but he wouldn’t listen and only yelled more.  It turned out my shoulder was dislocated and I needed a reverse replacement.  Although my shoulder still gives me pain all the time, I will not go back to be checked since he will scream more.  It is hard to believe this man continues to practice with patients leaving his office crying constantly.  ",Male
"I am very impressed with Dr.  D'agostini.. He has performed surgery on my right foot as well as both hips. H e was thorough and informative and I felt very safe in his care. I had no complications and am walking better than I did 20 yrs ago. He is a man who
enjoys his work and is proud of all the success stories he has",Male
"Game day matters!
This man has perfected his art.
Had total knee Friday morning and was HOME by 1:00pm that day!
I could not have even imagined it would have went this well.
Nw it is up to me to do my PE and follwow up visits.",Male
"I can't give him any stars due to his poor attitude and demeanor.  However, I can't complete my survey unless I give him one mercy star.  He is rude, arrogant, and throws other employees in his practice under the bus.  ",Male
"Dagastino is probably the rudest person I've ever met in my life. I cannot believe he has a career in healthcare. This man is redefining dismissive and condescending. A blowhard know-it-all with whom I would never waste another moment of my time.  I think his bloated sense of self-esteem makes him think he is a straight shooter, but in actuality he is ill mannered and rude.",Male
Dr. D Agostini jr  is excellent doctor he performed my hip replacement years ago and I'm without  pain for 10 years and I'm still playing golf  it's all because of Dr. D Agostini,Male
Awful human makes u wait hour after ur appointment and he's clueless. ,Male
"There is at least a 1 hour wait AFTER your appointment time to see Dr. D'agostini, and he is not nice. So probably go with someone else.",Male
"On 5/15/16, Dr D'Agostino, met with my Mom (85 yrs) suffering hip pain, yet to be diagnosed. After denigrating his own staff as idiots  he offered my mother no surgical  pain relief  but would still be the cutter or just  narc the rest of her life  Walked out on her when she asked about a 2nd opinion. I guess Medicare patients are not his bankroll, Shame on this doctor. No 2nd visit to this  practice.(Numerous direct calls to the practice as to his arrogance and uncaring demeanor).Bad business",Male
"I saw 3 orthopedic surgeons for evaluation for my hip given to me by a friend in the medical field. He said they are all good, use who you are most comfortable with. Dr. D'gostini was the last Dr. I saw.  He was the only Dr. to inform me that some Dr.s in Europe think there may be a chance of titanium rubbing off into the blood stream if using titanium on titanium. Dr. D was upfront, pulled no punches. Bedside manner, who cares, he knows his stuff and is respected by all. 2 hips later thank you",Male
"Friendly, informative and caring. He took excellent care of my mother and called to give us updates on her condition while she was hospitalized. ",Male
saved my sister twice now.  excellent doctor who probes til he finds the real issue. doesn't waste time trying everything under the sun.,Male
"In my career, I have lived in many cities and towns of various sizes. I have been in the health care industry for several years. I am fortunate to have had very good quality physicians throughout my life. Dr. D'Agostino is the single best internist and primary care physician I have met. He is knowledgeable, thorough and a great listener. He takes time to listen, research, study and respond while empowering and inspiring me to make healthy choices to optimize my health. ",Male
"Dr. D'Agostino is a fine surgeon and a very kind doctor who shows compassion and caring. I was terrified to undergo open heart surgery until I met and talked with him. He put my mind at ease. The surgery went smoothly, and I recuperated quickly. Thank you, Dr. D. ",Male
"From a RN prospective: I have worked with many docs. Hands down, she's the best I have ever seen. Her bedside manner is excellent. Her outcomes are excellent. She's very very smart with great attention to detail. She currently is a hospitalist at East Cooper hospital in Mt. Pleasant SC at the time of this review",Female
Dr. D’Agostino did my surgery to remove  my Parathyroid  in October 2018 and my Gallbladder surgery January 2020.I have a very little scar..He  is a wonderful surgeon and takes time to really listen to your questions..I highly recommend Dr. D’Agostino,Male
Dr Dagostino is an excellent surgeon with an equally great patient manner. He performed surgery on me this past summer when no one else would do to the complications of my case. I will be eternally grateful to him for the great work he did!,Male
"Wonderful surgeon! Dr. D'Agostino performed two procedures on me and each time left very minimal scarring for each of this very self-conscience woman.  Such a kind disposition and makes you feel very at ease with everything. His staff was wonderful and on top of everything. I can not say enough for him or his team. I tell anyone I know that is having a procedure done, that this is the Dr. I would use. Absolutely love this man! ",Male
"On the last days of  February my Primary doctor sent me to Dr Joseph Dagostino Jr. for consultation.He advise surgery of Gallbladder.I was scare and he smile at me and told me nothing to worry about everything will be OK.He is a great surgeon and make the patient feel comfortable.Great personality.Everything went fine and I want to recommend Dr.Dagostino to other people,Also I want to say thank you Dr. for your kind words to me.God Bless you always! Carmen E.Cazard",Male
I am so happy to say Dr. D'Agostino has been nothing short of amazing!! He performed a miracle in that operating room. My mother was severely hemmhoraging and needed emergency surgery to stop bleeding in her duodenum. He persevered beyond and was able to stabilize her after 2.5 hours. I am beyond grateful and words cannot explain how thankful I am to have had him at her side. He is truly genuine and shows his passion for his profession in countless ways. A truly wonderful man and professional!,Male
"I worked with Dr. D in the IOP at Silver Hill. He's the best! He explained things, and always took time with me. I'll miss working with him.;",Male

"Outstanding experience with Dr. D'Agostino.  Excellent surgeon who was kind, compassionate and took the time to explain my situation  as well as answer all of my questions.  Highly recommend.  Could not have asked for a better experience anywhere.  ",Male
Dr D'Agostino is an excellent orthopedic surgeon and recently did a superb job repairing my torn rotator cuff. I have amazing movement and I owe it all to Dr D!!,Male
"I recommended him already.  Caring, well spoken without fancy medical terms,  just an overall wonderful doctor and person.  Went out of his way to help me.",Male
"Dr. D'Agostino is the complete professional. He explained the procedure I would need (miniscus repair) and encouraged me to ask questions. His office runs smoothly and all staff are friendly and courteous. 
On the day of my surgery, Dr. D'Agostino greeted me and explained again what the surgery would entail and what I could expect post surgery. The surgery was a complete success!",Male
My knee surgery was total success.  Highly recommend!,Male
Dr. D'Agostino is very friendly and caring.  He took his time with me and answered all my questions.  My husband and I liked him very much right from the start. He took great care of me before knee surgery and after.  I have complete confidence in Doctor DAgostino and St. Francis Hospital.,Male
Dr. D'Agostino was referred to me by a friend. I saw him for a torn meniscus. He took his time to answer all of my questions. Excellent bedside manner. Extremely pleased with the outcome of my surgery. I would used him again and most definitely would recommend him to anyone who needed arthroscopic knee surgery.,Male
"Dr. D'Agostino, MD saved my father's life.... in surgery for a very long time and would not give up and did everything he possibly could to save my fathers heart which had a number of difficulties.  I thought it was a miracle but in fact it was the experience, dedication, strength, perseverance, and expertise of this Dr. that saved my father's life.  Without a doubt if another family member was in need, there would not be another doctor for us to call.",Male
"From the day we met, Dr. D'Agostino and his team were better than I could have asked for. I had 2 heart valves replaced and was in OR for 12 hours. As life changing as it was for me, i never had a moment of doubt that I was going to b better than before. I would recommend him to everyone needing heart valve repair/replacement.  Lahey is blessed to have him work for them. His nursing staff led by NP
 Kathleen Garabedian were as professional and personal also.",Male
"Went in to talk to him about anxiety issues I was having. very dismissive and condescending. Refused to review my history with another doctor. Very patronizing, treated me, a grown woman like a child. My first visit was my last with this so called doctor. He needs to retire.",Male
Don't go to Dr D'Agostino. He's older and should retire. He is excepting patients but must be having a difficult time. He doesn't care about his patients or even bothers to check on their background. Just goes by the Book. I had one experience with him and it will be my last. There is something wrong with this facility as the last two Doctors we had walked out leaving us with Dr DAgostino our only choice. Will look else where.,Male
"I am a patient with end stage liver issues, today  this weasel cancelled an appointment 3 hours before I was scheduled to be there.  

He has been my PCP (mostly in name only) for three years, and has been seemingly retired in-place for most of that time.

Nobody called to tell me he would no longer see me, I learned when I called to confirm the appointment!

When is it time for the state to revoke his credentials?",Male
"I was his 1st appt but he arrived 1/2 hr late. Nurse confided he's late EVERY morning. He never read my history or previous medical records. He hadn't studied my lab test results and didn't do so until I instructed him to.  He was ignorant of the nature of a surgery I had, and I had to explain it to him.  He botched my Rx's - The pharmacist had to correct them - he referred me to the wrong specialist for a procedure. Says he's thinking of retirement.. I agree that would be a good decision.",Male
He gets to know you as a person. He follows up shows concern and consideration. Very unique caring individual he found a serious medical condition that my previous doctor ignored very grateful for him ,Male
"Great manner, listener and good at explaining things that anyone will understand.",Male

"January 2010 Dr. D' Agostino saved my life. I had been to several doctors, several emergency rooms with severe headache troubles where I was giving pain meds and sent home. Dr. D' Agostino made the decision to perform an an emergency brain surgery/operation a mere 3 hrs from the first time we met. Brain aneurysm or stroke would have undoubtedly been my future had he not acted immediately and took action.......SAY THIS GUY IS GOOD!!! If a neurosurgeon is what you need in your life Dr. D'Agostino is the best and anybody in a situation calling for his type of service-his expertise and experience put him up at the top of his field! I know this review doesn't make up for not making a single payment to the doctor but if he should ever read this...THANKS BROTHER -GOD BLESS YOU",Male
"My mother had spinal surgery with Dr D’Agostino on March 13,2019 and that is the last time she saw his face. Pre op went well and she was very confident in her decision with choosing him but the post op care has been nothing but a nightmare! The lack of communication with him and is staff is beyond unprofessional! He can care less about his patients after surgery. I would NEVER recommend this place!",Male
D'agostino Is a awesome Dr who knows what he is doing in the surgery room and in the office .D'agostino had installed the new Intellis platform spinal cord stimulator in my neck and lower back in October 2017. D'agostinos office staff and himself is 2nd to none. If you have back problems that need to be addressed than D'agostino is the one to call upon. I would recommend no other. I thank Dr D'agostino his staff for everything and wish them a happy and safe Thanksgiving.Sincerely Jeff Harrington,Male
"I had an appointment to have severe spinal stenosis, that my Gp. doctor said I had,  with Dr. D'Agostino on 9/21. he said that he could not determine my problem with ct scan that I brought him. he suggested that I have a myleogram.  I had a myleogram done on oct. 3rd. waited to hear from him on a follow up visit per his directions.called his office after 2weeks. no appt. no call from dr. it has been one month minus 3 days since my first visit. got release. obivous he has more patients ,then time",Male
"Unless the diagnostic is easy and clear he will not even bother to show interest or treat you. He told me nerve conduction studies were useless. He ordered an MRI, it took his office 4 weeks to process. They were very rude. For three weekes ignored calls inquiring about the results. The day before my follow up his office called to say the MRI did not show anything and he could not offer me help. Another doctor found the problem (disc hernia) after ordering a nerve study. Don't waste your time",Male
Two back surgeries with DrD'Agostino. Best there is in my opinion. ,Male
"It had to take 13 days for him to call me back  from the second time I pleaded with his office to have someone call me and I am not happy with it. He seems to ignore a lot of my concerns and now I am forced to go back to work, because of the lack of communication and I am very disappointed in him and his office. I will not recommend them. I have to beg his office and still no reply back even within 72 hrs no return phone call. HOW SAD! ! They rarely keep their word!",Male
I was referred to him during an emergency situation in the hospital.  He came into pre-op and explained why I should not have the planned surgery.  He gave me and my husband enough information to make a good decision and immediately agreed for him to do a major surgery the following week.

"Sadly Dr Peter R. D'Alena passed away July 9, 2017 after retiring in Medford, OR in 2001. Unsure who continues to update his office/medical profile without knowing anything about him.",Male
"I've seen Dr. D'Alessandri for several years now. She's great, very down to earth, and intelligent. She doesn't rush you in your appointments and doesn't try to talk over your head. Plus she's very personable.",Female
LOVE her!  She takes the time to listen and genuinely cares for her patients.,Female
"My children have been patients of Dr. D'Alessandri and I couldn't ask for a better doctor. She's very easy to talk to, takes her time with her patients, and is very friendly and knowledgeable. I'm going to be a new patient with her and I'm very excited to get such a wonderful doctor! Very pleased and I definitely recommend her!",Female
Dr. D'Alessandri is great! ,Female
"""Dr. D"" is without a doubt the best Doctor in Florida! I had my kids at a few different ones before finding her and I can't say enough great things about HER as a person, and as a Mother herself, but how she approaches healthcare is extremely rare, responsible and needs to be modeled by ALL Doctors, especially those caring for our children! Thank you Dr. D, don't ever leave!",Female
"Dr. D is everything you’d want/need in a pediatrician! We’ve been seeing her since our oldest was born. He is 8 now and we have two other children, 2 &amp; 3. Dr. D is super caring, knowledgeable and takes the time to make sure you understand everything you need to know. I don’t know if you’ll see this, but THANK YOU DR. D! We love and appreciate you!",Female
She has been our pediatrician since my son was born 19 months ago. We really like her. She is approachable and doesn’t make you feel stupid for asking a lot of questions. I am pleased with her office.,Female
"Dr. D'Alesandro is phenomenal, as is her nurse Cassie. They are warm, sensitive, extremely knowledgeable, and easy to work with. The doctor has even called us to see how our child was doing after treatment. I don't know what we'd do without her!
",Female
Dr D'Alessandro is exactly what I want in a doctor. She takes her time and listens to us.  The way she explains things to my girls is impressive. She knows how to communicate with them no matter their age.  We are very lucky to have her taking care of our girls. ,Female
Cannot say enough good things about Dr. D'Alessandro.  5 stars in all categories. He performed surgery in June 2019.,Male
"Not only a world class surgeon, but really cares for his patients  MGH is lucky to have him ",Male
Fantastic Dr. in the operating room and during recovery,Male
"Fastest ""skin check"" ever. He was in and out in about 3 minutes, asked zero questions and did not ask if I had any questions. I think I will schedule another appointment with a different Doctor and self pay if I have to. I have a sister with a history of melanoma and I have had 3 basal cell lesions removed from my face. I had questions but decided not to ask based on his poor bedside manner.",Male
"I should have been suspicious of this doctor when I could find no reviews about him.  I was referred to Dr. D'Alessandro by my PCP because D'Alessandro had joined my PCP's group in Eugene, and that's the only reason I risked seeing him.  I won't go back.  He was hostile and arrogant, with zero bedside manner.  He overly froze a pre-cancerous spot on my hand that has left a large unsightly scar.  I called my PCP and advised them to stop referring patients to Dr. D'Alessandro. ",Male
"I have seen him for annual screenings for a few years.  Dr. D'Alessandro is always very thorough, professional and pleasant.  He performed minor surgery and provided excellent follow up.  I have recommended him to friends over the years.",Male
"You feel like you're just number, he has no time for questions or concerns, okay for things like blood pressure or cholesterol issues but beyond that find someone else.",Male
I find him to rush you through so fast that he doesn't listen to your questions or concerns. Also doesn't have time for a thourough exam and diagnosis.,Male
"Bad experience. He treated me for Hashimoto's. He does not give you the care you need, he doesn't listen to you. He only cares about himself, about having his internet, fax, phones working and not being late to his board meetings. He forces you to have and appointment just to have refills. He told me that I would be taking my medicine for life and but I haven't taken my medicine since September 1, 2016 and my thyroid is working properly now thanks to my faith, diet and stress management.",Male
Office is easy to find and there is a blood lab and x-ray facilities in the same building so its very convenient when you need a few extra tests run.  I personally like the fact that he doesn't sugar coat things and talks to you like a real person.,Male
No bedside manner . Doesn't care about his patients . Won't refill prescriptions until they go in for a visit. Rude staff . ,Male
"Dr.D has hands of gold! He saved my life, 2 caroited arterie surgeries. He is the best in his feild.",Male

"Dr. D'Alessandro is an outstanding surgeon, he is compassionate, gentle and cares a great deal for his patients comfort and concerns.  Very professional.",Male
Dr. D'Alessandro is a very thorough and caring physician. He is the only Dr. that I have seen that gives you a complete examination. I have many specialists that write in their reports that they have checked all of your body systems when in reality they have checked none. Wonderful Dr.,Male
"After waiting weeks to be seen in the office, the doctor was dismissive, rude, and extremely unprofessional .
Aggressive in tone and did not take a minute to sit and talk about test results. Very disappointing. Would not recommend him to my worst enemy. ",Male
"I was a patient of Dr D’Alessio’s at PMP and have the greatest respect for her as a doctor and a person. She was thorough and caring and compassionate with a true understanding of fibromyalgia and pain, which is so incredibly difficult to find. She is a great doctor.",Female
"Dr D'Alessio has been nothing but amazing so far, helping me so much more than words can describe. She has great compassion and kindness and really tries to get to the bottom of your issues and figure out the best ways to help. I have a not so straightforward case and have been to many rheumatologists and specialists who just tell me to take a bunch of pills and don't spend the time to explain how immunocomprimising they may be or how sick they can make you, and she is helping me combat these side effects and get to the bottom of things. I can always tell her how I feel and what I don't like about my treatments and she will listen and be there for me when I am at my lowest points.",Female
"Dr. D'alessio is the most caring doctor with holly hands . He is absolutely wonderful skilled doctor with tremendous care for the patients,  beautiful personality , calm and confident.  I recommend him to everyone in need,  personally I believe  he is the best . His team is also GREAT !

He is most caring, most compassionate, respectful, a people person, easy to communicate with and an excellent doctor....a true professional.",Male
"Dr. D'Alessio is a highly skilled stomach surgeon. He removed a tumor from my stomach at Bethesda West Hospital in August 2019.  He explained the procedure prior to operating on me. I asked the Lord to Bless Dr. D'Alessio's hands before he operated on me. He was a God send, he performed a highly successful surgery! His skill and medical intelligence allowed very little pain during recovery. Again, I am a praying man, and I believe God sent me to a highly competent and skilled surgeon in Dr. Matthew D'Alessio! I award him with 5 stars!",Male
"This man carried out a procedure on me at Bethesda West Hospital. When I returned with heavy internal bleeding 2 weeks later, he told me it was hemorrhoids and sent me home. 12 hours later I returned with a head injury, due to loss of blood and a fall, and he finally had to fix his error. I needed a blood transfusion also. he was not even man enough to come and see me in the hospital afterwards, and I was finally discharged by a nurse. A spineless excuse of a man.",Male
"If you are looking for a dedicated and a skilled surgeon, Dr D’Alessio is the doctor you want. I had stomach surgery on 1-18-18 to remove my stomach because of stomach cancer. I had a previous stomach surgery in 1969, so Dr D’Alisso had to deal with a lot scar tissue and adhesions which made the surgery more complicated. He was able to remove the tumor and save some of my stomach. I was out of the hospital in 7 days. Dr D’Alessio always took the time to explain the surgery and my questions.",Male
Dr operated on a relative of mine. He was way over his head. Would give negative 5 stars,Male
"Dr. D'Alessio is a life savior. I had a hemorrhoid removed and the procedure was about 15- 20mins. 
It was absolutely painless and surprisingly quick. 
Recovery from this type of procedure does take some time and it is painful, but the experience
was as good as it gets. 
Very happy and would definitely recommend anyone to go see the doc!",Male
"Dr. D'Alessio is the absolute BEST. I had surgery in 2010 and he and his staff were top notch. They are all extremely professional, compassionate and trustworthy. Dr. D'Alessio had to do a complicated liver and gall bladder surgery and he did a great job.  I highly recommend him!",Male
"Dr. D'Alessio operated on my 74 year old father for pancreatic cancer. His bedside manner was unparalleled. We were very worried, and had unending questions about the procedure. He made sure that we understood everything. He called us back when he wasn’t available, and made us feel comfortable and assured. I’m happy to report the surgery was a resounding success. I would recommend Dr.  D’Alessio to anyone.",Male
Dr. D'Alessio performed surgery on my 87 year old Mother.  I was very nervous and quite frankly skeptical about the entire procedure.  He took the time to reassure me that this was the correct route to go.  He did the procedure two weeks and one day ago.  We went today for a follow up visit.  Very excited to say that she is healing well and moving in the direction for a totally recovery.  This Doctor truly cares about his patients and is evident in his work!  Thank you Dr. D'Alessio!,Male
"The nicest most compassionate doctor I have ever met in my life!!! Treats you like a human and not a number. Talks to you from the heart and takes the time to make you comfortable and makes sure you understand everything.

"Dr. D is one of the most empathetic, knowledgeable, and attentive Physicians I have ever met, in my 80 years of receiving their assistance and guidance, concerning my health!  She is, to me, and Angel in a Dr's smock, I can not recommend her too highly!  Her attention and medications have given me a new life, truly!",Female
Absolutely amazing Doctor. She really thinks about her patients. She is thorough in her care of you.  I absolutely adore her.,Female
"I visited Dr. D'Alessio with a serious breathing problem that had been misdiagnosed previously by several other physicians.  This issue was preventing me from leaving my house because of my sensitivity to many triggers.  Dr. D'Alessio diagnosed my breathing problem, and recommended I use an over-the-counter medication, and referred me for breathing exercise therapy.  My condition immediately improved.  I now breathe normally and have not had any episodes for months.  I highly recommend Dr. D'Alessio for anyone with breathing problems.",Female
"If you have questions, she takes time to make sure they are all answered in a way you can understand. She is so kind and compassionate, and really knows her stuff. I would trust her with any member of my family; and coming from a nurse that says a lot! Thanks for the amazing care you have given to me, my patients and the community.",Female
"She has successfully diagnosed a disease that had been unrecognized by other pulmonologists for FIFTEEN YEARS!!! Additionally, she actually LISTENS, and responds conversationally. She is understanding and compassionate. ",Female
My experience in Dr. D'Alessio's office was nothing short of exceptional. I was greeted by a very friendly staff and Dr. D'Alessio spent extra time answering all of my questions. I never felt rushed like I have at other offices.  I would highly recommend this practice.,Female
"This office is unreasonable.  I had to miss, not cancel, an appointment due an IBS attack. The office was notified at 8:00am for a 1:00pm appointment that I was too ill to make the appointment. Both the doctor and Barbara charged me $100 for canceling the appointment which I did not do.  Sometimes it's unreasonable to expect a sick person who is being treated by a physician for IBS to be denied empathy and understanding.  I will NEVER go to this doctor and neither should you. Barbara is smug.",Female
"Dr D'alessio is compassionate,thorough, intelligent &amp; explains things so that I can understand them. She works with my other doctors, that is very important to me .  The issue I have is trying to speak to a real person, or get a return call or portal message . The voicemail message is  offensive-it seems like they dont want to help""- Example: ""Leaving more than one message will prolong call back"".  should be omitted . If they dont call me back,  I have to leave additional messages/portal msg.",Female
"Dr Santa D'Alessio is very compassionate, professional, &amp; knowledgeable. The problem is that this office does not answer the phone or return phone calls. Ive called and messaged them several times over the past few weeks &amp; never gotten a response. I am an elderly patient and having issues breathing, I needed to talk to the doctor to see if I could come in sooner than my scheduled visit. They've built a fortress around the office. Dr Santa D'Alessio should have a more patient centered office.",Female
"Today was my first visit. Dr. D’Alessio spent over an hour with me, asking great questions and really listening to me. I have never had a good a first impression of a physician. ",Female

Second time I needed to have surgery and I chose Dr. D. Very nice and appears to be a great surgeon. ,Male
I met w/ Dr. D’Almeida after being told I needed my gallbladder removed. Postsurgery I was having the same issues &amp; he said he may not have needed to remove it. I got the bill &amp; began making payments. The office called me saying my payments weren't enough. I tried to explain I had several bills &amp; was doing the best I could but they kept harassing me. I took out a loan to make the payment but today I received my money in the mail. Worst place ever. They make you feel like less than a person! ,Male
"Never felt more comfortable.  
Explains throughly.  And answers questions without hesitation and does not hold back.   Tells it like it is!  
Talks to you like a friend. ",Male
"Best ER physician I have ever had the opportunity to work with and to help me in my time of need. She takes the time to talk to you and answer all of your questions. I went in for a swollen arm and right away she assessed the situation and ordered tests. Dr. D’Alo then went over those test results to reassure to me that I did not have a DVT in my arm. I also have had the privilege to work with her. I am an EMT and St. Clair hospital is were I frequented while doing clinical time for my certification. It’s not everyday that you run into an ER physician that remembers you let alone what they had treated/seen you for. She asked how I was and at that time I realized that she is a one of a kind doctor and person. Like I said before one of the best ER physicians around and just an overall great person. 

Thank you Dr. D’Alo 

Sincerely,

Shelby Adams",Female
"My experience with Dr. D’Alo was absolutely terrific.   Though a tough morning, I was relieved instantly through her a depth of knowledge and care and concern. Very grateful. Thank you, Tracy",Female
" Saw Dr. D'Alo in the emergency room of St. Clair Hospital  while I was in distress. I thought she was absolutely terrific. She has a great bedside manner,  quickly assess the situation and couldn't have been more helpful in  presenting complicated information, and assisting me in making decisions.   Couldn't have been more pleased with her knowledge, skill  and bedside manner. ",Female
She is a snake and not to be trusted. Would not advise any other patients to experience her. She deserves karma,Female
"Dr. D'Alton is incredibly kind, compassionate and thorough. I felt like there were a lot of eyes on me at her practice. I had a very challenging pregnancy due to past traumas and my anxiety was astronomical. She was supportive, accommodating and patient with me, and I was not an easy patient.  I am so grateful to her.",Female
"My PCP referred me to Dr. D'Alton for care during my first pregnancy.  I found the practice to be robotic and impersonal.  I felt like the doctors and staff were treating a uterus and not a person.  Dr. D'Alton, *my* doctor, entered the room at the end of my first appointment for less than 2 minutes and did not say more than 10 words.  None of the medical staff acknowledged that this was an exciting and nervous time and they did not keep me informed of my own care.",Female
"This man doesn't listen to his patients, more interested in drug cost. Then actually listening to what my actual problem is. ",Male
"Well I had hernia surgery and had complications when they tried to put in my catheter. This practice was called in to assist as I was on the operating table at the time. I was to be visited before ,y realest as well as get the catheter out. It took 10 calls over 5 days before they would take it out six days after the surgery. When I finally got the catheter out they noted that a follow up appoint,met for the issue found in the surgery was not set up despite me asking for that was well in each of my calls.D? Armato was assigned to me and I have yet to meet him. I can tell you his nurse appeared to care less and apologized for the poor treatment of the practice though she was the one I was speaking to mostly. I asked to speak t the manager. Spoke to her on Tuesday and have been chasing her since. It is now Saturday. When I looked on line there are many complaints about this office in scheduling and follow up so not sure if it is the Doctor or the admin support that is deficient.",Male
Dr D'Amato continues to provide excellent care for my complicated situation.  I am glad he has been my opthalmologist for a long time.,Male

She delivered both of my boys, and I couldn't ask for more love from a doctor!  You are in great hands with her!  She always takes your time and answers all of your questions!",Female
"The only thing I would change is being able to schedule appointments online. Overall Dr. D'Amato and her staff are very friendly and welcoming. I have never felt uncomfortable and she explains everything easily and doesn't treat you like you are stupid, no matter how dumb the question. I definitely recommend her.",Female
"Dr. D?Amato is personable and takes time to answer all my questions and concerns. I have never felt she is rushing me through, even during a visit where she had to squeeze me in to address a problem. I am confident I am in good hands with her. Dr. D?Amato?s nurse/medical assistant displayed concern and was very helpful when I had minor complications after surgery. She is always ready with a smile. The office staff is pleasant and they try to accommodate my schedule when making appointments. ",Female
Judgmental. Does not listen to the patient or family. Very brief exam. ,Male
Very professional excellent bed side manners. Explained everything very well and he reads the Xray him self so there is no waiting.,Male
Obviously not one to take appointments seriously. Cancels then rescheduled then rescheduled again all on telemed. Apparently the corona has her crazed. In office not in office. Procedures on Monday only for those 60 and under. More money on them than Medicare patients. Do not get it ! What happened to the Hippocratic Oath? Talk about privileged. Too bad her attitude needs adjustment as she is an excellent doctor when you get to see her and you are lucky enough to have her do a procedure on you.,Female
"Love Dr. D’Amato! I’ve been her patient for years. She has always listened and worked with me to find the best possible non-invasive procedures to ensure that I am as pain-free as I can be:). She is compassionate, patient  and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the issues with my spine. I have complete trust in both her and the entire University Spine Center team.",Female
Dr D’Amato was thorough and helped me figure out my chronic lower back pain issues. Office staff was great.,Female

"Dr.Damato did both of my lumbar injections with no guarntee I'd have relief....6 months later and I STILL feel great.

"The Bonita Beach office fax # was not accepting the required medical referral.  The staff failed to provide us with their alternate fax #, resulting in the patient being sent away, in pain, for another week.  Patient, a medical worker on her feet all day, suffered daily.  Ofc mgr, Shannon took no responsibility stating a reschedule/2nd co-pay was appropriate.  Do the PMC physicians realize how their offices are being run?  Patient care/satisfaction are not the priority.",Male
"Very thorough, explains everything he is doing.  Office staff is also
very good.
",Male
Wonderful human being. Very knowledgeable and compassionate,Male
"This doctor and like most of you thought he was the sweetest and most understanding person I had ever met but there is a dark side to him, like Jekyll &amp; Hyde. I witnessed with my own eyes and ears and is the reason I left it immediately and then he turned even nastier. I would NOT recommend this doctor to anybody. The secretary did not know what she doing and then was rude on top of all that. Forget about it. His office is in the basement of his house and is a complete dump.",Male
"Dr. D'Amato is the most caring doctor I have ever encountered. He is very smart, competent, and loving to his patients. Besides being a hottie, he can dress very well for work. I love his style!! I remember him telling me that everything would be ok, it just takes time. I definitely will refer him to any of my friends and family that may ever need him. Finally, he got me through my problems successfully and I don't know how to thank him.",Male
"I could not even get an appointment with this doctor. Whoever answered, whether it be staff or the doctor himself was incredibly rude. It got the impression that they don't even want patients. I have Magnacare insurance and explained why I needed the appointment and the man sighed with annoyance and told me to make an appointment with Christ Hospital. VERY RUDE and not helpful AT ALL. You would think someone who needs to see a psychiatrist would get better treatment or more direction. ",Male
"Dr. D'Amato has been both knowledgeable and supportive over the past 9 years of our Dr./Patient relationship. She has some understanding of other forms of medicine beyond Osteopathy, and is willing to develop unique treatment plans that work for individuals with multiple challenges. I have heard her praises sung by many. I trust her because she knows her science, and likes her work.",Female

"I have seen Dr. D'Ambra for many years and she is the most thorough Dermatologist and the most caring doctor I have ever met.

I have sent everyone I know to her.",Female
"Went to Dr D'Ambra multiple times and ended with a misdiagnosis. Eventually found out it was cancer (from a different doctor) and one of my radiation oncologist asked my symptoms and I told them. They said it was a classic symptom for what cancer I had. Somehow after 3 visits, she completely missed this and had me coming back again and again.  Very upsetting to say the least, and instead of only radiation, I had to have chemo too since it was not caught early.",Female

"Dr. D is a life saver. I have a rare nerve syndrome, CRPS,  that went undiagnosed until I saw him. For two months I was being told that all I had was is a high ankle sprain, that I should be walking on it. No one could understand why it was so painful that I couldn’t have a bed sheet on it, let alone walk on it. The first time I saw Dr. D he said he knew what was wrong with me. Not only did he save me whole life from falling apart,  he also gave me the best advise I ever received, “Go home and educate yourself”. He gives so much of his time and always adds you to the schedule so he can help with the pain. Not only is he knowledgable and caring but he is conservative in his treatment. I’m lucky I got to see him. I’m lucky his staff works as hard and is as kind as him. This is a wonderful practice and, in my opinion, the best doctor.",Male

Two short visits later, I have no back or hip pain, even after hiking 20+ miles in a day several times, and moving a room full of furniture! Dr D. and his staff have great ""bedside manners"".

"We were impressed with Doctor D'Ambrosia when we saw him the first time.  He was sympathetic, caring and focused on the issue of my wife’s pain.  He was quick to identify my wife’s issues and determine a plan to follow to improve her pain situation.  We left pleased to be seeing him and we had hope for some quick improvement.
Our problems were not with the Doctor but getting back to see him.  My wife has been in terrible pain for some time.  She had a procedure that was recommended by Dr D. to help relieve the pain.  She did get some relief, but unfortunately the relief didn’t last very long.
I called the doctor’s office to see if I could get her into see someone quickly to see where we are to go next.  I had to leave a message because everyone was busy.  I left a message that my wife was in extreme pain and probably was going to need surgery.

My partner goes to Dr. D'ambrosia and he has always been an advocate for her and constantly assists her to navigate the complicated medical system to get proper treatment for a rare nervous condition.

"Dr. D'Ambrosio is fantastic.  It is a shame the scheduling is such a nightmare and the nurse is both rude and difficult.Twice she tried to deny an emergency appt. Once for my child's tick bite w/ skin infection and once for an ER referral.  No call back the last time I tried to schedule an emergency appt.  Additionally, we sat in the waiting room for more than hour waiting for a scheduled vaccination. This accounts for all but 1 visit outside of physicals.",Male

"Dr. D’ Ambrosio explained my MRI and detailed the procedural options for trigeminal neuralgia knowing that I had been on multiple pain meds which had stopped helping.

I feel blessed to have been referred to him by my neurologist. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend Dr. D to someone with neurological pain.",Male

"Dr. D'Ambrosio recently treated me for a subdural hematoma. His knowledge and expertise helped me make a full recovery. The whole injury was a very stressful and painful process on my family and I.

"Five years ago (2012) a tumor was discovered in my brain and an hour later I met Dr. D'Ambrosio.  When he came into the ER to introduce himself to my husband and me and explain what was going to happen I felt completely at ease.  I'll never forget him telling me, with a smile, ""And I won't shave your head.""  Competence is expected.

Distant and unconcerned,Male
"If I could leave a -10 rating I would. I'm handicapped special needs patient with PTSD. Some doctors don't have the skills to deal with patients like me. This guy takes it to a new level. If you ever wonder if medical staff really scoff at people with mental illness, trauma, or any sort of  disability...send them his direction. Five minutes with him will set the record straight. He tried to tell me my MRI showed nothing. And said I should go see someone else.",Male
"On second dr here. Left first one (glander) because he was rude &amp; no bedside manner at all. Only answered questions on paper or computer &amp; tried to tell me my symptoms were wrong.

"He does not listen to his patients, stands up and rushes you out the door. Looks at the laptop and not in your face. ",Male
"I'm told that Dr. D'Ambrosio knows the answer to the questions he is asking me. He doesn't know my answers because he doesn't listen. He has poor eye contact, doesn't seem engaged at all. He ask a question and gazes at his lap top. I won't answer his questions until he looks at me. Neuro is a tough field...I get that! I'm a nurse and they don't know it. When I express my concern to my Primary Dr.She says that when specialists see what meds I take, they think I am drug seeking. Wrong on any level",Male
I have went to this dr for 2 years off and on he knows exactly whats wrong and keeps trying to treat me for nerve damage and I have spinal stenosis from c 3 threw c7  if it isn't corrected I will be paralyzed if I fall or in a wreck  they did balace test I had to go back for the same test because the nurse did not know how to use the machine I would not recommend this dr to anyone  and the staff are very rude doctors take oths to help people gave me meds not allowed in usa  I almost died,Male
When my son was sick he was the only dr. Who was reassuring and gave the correct diagnosis. The pediatric gastroenterologist was condescending and wrong. Thank god for dr's like dr. D'ambrosio.,Male

"If you’re looking for unprofessional, careless “medical” care and an opioid prescription no questions asked, this is the doctor for you. How many people need to become addicts before his license is revoked?",Male
"Disgusted!  He told my 90 year old mother, who has been a patient for years, that he could no longer be her doctor.  The reason was that he didn’t see her enough.  He didn’t provide her with any recommendations on another doctor.  She left the office in shock and is now tasked with finding a new doctor.  He should be ashamed of himself.",Male
"I've been relatively satisfied with the nurse practitioner but recently had the most unpleasant experience of my life with a health care ""professional."" A week ago, I came down with a sinus infection. I saw the nurse practitioner and was prescribed a 5-day Z-pak. Over the 5 days, I improved slightly. Then, several days after the treatment, I got much worse. When I realized the situation, it was, unfortunately, Christmas night. I called the answering service, hoping the on-call Dr. would be kind enough to call in a prescription. Dr D, who was on call, did take the time to call me back. He said: ""Do you know what day it is? Do you know what time it is? The office opens at 9am tomorrow."" When I reiterated my situation, he repeated himself and hung up. I find this behavior unprofessional to put it mildly. After searching online, it seems this kind of behavior is not an isolated incident. Beware if he is your Dr, and your are ill at a time he finds inconvenient.",Male

Recently switched my primary care to Dr. D'Ambrosio and couldnt be more thrilled with care i've received from him and his staff.   ,Male
"I watched Dr D’Ambrosio severely mishandle my mother’s life threatening medical conditions. He is highly unprofessional, lackadaisical and a jokester, not things that I look for in a primary care physician. This doctor has patience because of who he is, who his brother is and the town he lives in but that’s it. Do yourself and your love ones a favor and see somebody else. His old-school methods are outdated and dangerous. ",Male
"A caring, personable, and experienced physician who brings great skill and commonsense to healthcare.  His approaches are practical and take into consideration the specific situation of the patient.

Surrounding him is a great team focused on providing the best care and service possible.

I have had Dr. D for over 25 yrs I love him.. He has always been there for me.. If I have a problem with staff I tell him.. He is a wonderful doctor...... I try to always talk with Dawn when I call &amp; she is awsome...  So for anyone having problems with the staff tell Dr. D there name...,Male
Doctor was accommodating and helpful. Provided care with out over reaching. I don't generally like going to a Doctor and Dr. D'Ambrosio was reassuring.,Male
It feels like he just goes through the motions to get through the appointment.  I don't feel like he has any interest in really understanding or helping me with my health and the care I need. ,Male
"Dr. D'Ambrosio's  office has seen a turnover of a number of staff in the past year. Peggy, the nurse practitioner, who received praise from another reviewer has left the practice. Office personnel haven't been trained to deal with a population of elderly sick people, and as a result I find my experiences with them almost always produce negative encounters. I have no trust that my diagnosis is accurate and I plan to find another doctor. ",Male
"The staff are lazy and rude and do not want to help you , three different times while calling for an appoint I couldn't even get one they tried to pawn me off other places and made me feel as I was over reacting . You can never get in to actually see Dr D , and when you do your rushed .. And the new people are inadequate ..and rude ! ",Male
Awful awful awful.  Find someone else before you waste your time with this terrible practice. ,Male

"I have been with Dr. D'Ambrosio for almost 10 years now, at no point feeling pleased with the quality of care I have received.  Particularly in the last couple of years, when I don't even see him, but a nurse.  It's pretty shocking how little concern and care they show.  I would not recommend this practice to anyone.  I just had another really sub-par experience, which has prompted me to finally find a new doctor.",Male
Unimpressed with desk staff and practitioners. Thorough assessments have gone by the way side and indifference seems to have set in. I've been there twice recently and left feeling completely frustrated with the lack of concern for my health. I will not be returning. ,Male

"Dr D'Amico did not take the time to see if I had had previous MRI's.  By the looks of his report which stated No comparison available, he saw I was a little old lady with neck pain on Medicare.  I  have had 3 previous MRI's for him to compare with.  He did do an addendum stating the dates of the other findings but did not take the time to compare his readings with the others.  I am very unhappy with his service.",Male
Dr. Eaccarino is extremely kind and caring. He takes the time to listen to your concerns. I went into my appointment extremely nervous and worried and he took the time to settle my nerves by answering all of my questions. He even drew me a diagram to aid his explanation. I felt that he listened to my concerns and we discussed options. I have seen him twice now and both times I have left feeling understood and at ease. Highly recommend.,Male
"Dr. Eaccarino is very good looking and charming. I would not recommend the practice however because phone calls are never returned. I was scheduled for a pretty invasive test and given hormone pills without an exam. When I tried on several occasions to call, I was put into a voicemail system. Even to set up first appointment. The hormone pills made me bleed profusely. I tried on three different occasions to ask if I should stop taking the pills. My last call was never returned",Male
"Dr. Eaccarino took care of me my whole pregnancy and always went above and beyond. I always felt comfortable and important during my visits, and never left with questions unanswered. He even delivered my sweet baby boy and when the time comes, he will deliver my next one too!  

Dr. Eaccarinos nurse, Kristina, was amazing as well!  My husband and I couldn't have asked for a better Doctor!  I'll continue referring all of my friends to Dr. E, because we only want the best",Male
Dr Eaccarino is by far the best Obgyn I have ever consulted with. I felt comfortable and confident my entire pregnancy. He answered all my questions every time and never made me feel dismissed at any of our visits. After being in labor for 49 hours I had to have an emergency Csection. He performed it quickly and professionally. He was comforting every step of the way. I am one week postpartum and my incision is barely visible and completely healed. I highly recommend this amazing doctor!,Male
He wasn't knowledgeable and extremely inexperienced. Wouldn't listen to my concerns and had the doctor EGO everyone tries to avoid. The office was dirty and I waited a long time to be seen the first time I had to stand in the waiting room because all the seats were taken. ,Male

His office staff and office manager are the best! I've always had total communication with them.,Male
"More than 10 years ago my primary m.d. told me to get a check up by a urologist.  My daughter, who was an R.N and is now a Nurse Practitioner told me to see Dr. Ead.

As a provider myself I will tell you he is the BEST! He has saved many lifes and continues to do so. He is caring and sincere in every encounter. You will not find any like him. He gets all of my referrals and I feel confident each will be taken care of with the highest of quality. Only concern receptionist named Amy. My patients state she is extremely rude and often times will call my practice to get away from talking to her and we schedule appts. Amy needs to be more compassionate to patients.,Male
"Dr. Eades is my choice for a cardiologist. I'm in the healthcare profession and I guarantee you will never find a better, more caring, knowledgeable doctor.",Male
"Dr. Eades is extremely intelligent, informative, approachable and goes above and beyond addressing all my questions and concerns.  It gives me immense peace of mind knowing I am in the best possible hands.  My Rx refills are handled quickly and his wonderful staff are organized, kind and make my visits stressless.  I am very grateful to Dr. Eades,  as he is assisting me in stepping out of my family history of Heart Disease.  I have recommended him to everyone and will continue to do so.",Male
"Dr. Eades was the doctor on call when I had a heart attack. But I now drive over 20 miles each way to keep him as my cardiologist as I like his attitude, outlook  and his demeanor. When we go over the tests he takes the time to carefully explain each number, what they mean to me in real life and how they interact. He will make suggestions, explain why and not preach. If I ever have to wait to see him I assume it is because he is taking the same time with another patient so I willingly accept it.",Male
Dr Eades was great but his staff is HORRIBE. If u call and a Amy answers you should probably just hang up because she is worthless. She was rude to my wife and myself. I had to start showing up without appointment to see Dr Eades. ,Male
Dr. Eades is the most easy going and knowledgeable Cardiologist in the area.  He explains everything so well and he takes the time to be sure you understand everything.,Male
"I recommend Dr. Eades highly. He has a way of putting you at ease discussing your care. He went over things thoroughly, listened to all my questions and concerns. He did my surgery at Delta hospital (rectocele and hysterectomy) and I am thrilled with the results. The staff at the hospital was wonderful and my recovery went smoothly and a lot quicker than expected.",Male
The staff at Premier Women's was friendly and helpful throughout my pregnancy. It was my first baby and they made it a wonderful experience. Dr. Eades was my doctor and he is kind and very knowledgeable. He explained things well and answered all of my questions at my appointments and at the hospital. The Labor and Delivery unit at the hospital is very nice and so are the nurses. Delta has a great hospital. They offered so much education  and helped a lot with breastfeeding. ,Male
Not the greatest experience. My baby almost died. He is very well known for just going in once the baby is already born in the delivery room. He was not there while I was actually delivering the baby. The appointments are a minimum 2 hrs of wait time for a visit of 5 mins with him. I just did not have a good experience.,Male
Scheduling is a nightmare. ,Male
I contacted Dr. Eades about replacing breast implants that were 20 years old and one was slowly losing volume. After he explained my options I chose to exchange my old saline implants with silicone ones and also got a breast lift. I'm so happy with the results. Great office staff and great plastic surgeon.,Male
"Had a facelift, wow, went to different plastic surgeon about 8 yrs. ago and he did not even come close to the surgical excellence and results that Dr. Eades did and I experienced.
Dr. Eades and Anita, his assistant, are wonderful and warm, and most importantly, Dr. Eades is a perfectionist and a creative artist,  I  will NEVER go anywhere else......Also, I think, I look fantastic, even without makeup.",Male
I was very pleased with DR Eades. I would recommend him to anyone.,Male
"I am very happy with my facial surgery Dr. Eades did!   He accomplishes a natural look which I love!  He is calm and kind, and spends lots of time explaining the pros and cons of different procedures.  I highly recommend him.",Male
The best surgeon you will find. And as a reconstruction surgeon he makes you feel whole again. He is an artist. ,Male
Dr.Eades is an amazing plastic surgeon! He was able to correct a previous surgery with an outstanding outcome. From the moment you enter his office you are greeted by a wonderful staff named Anita and Alyssa.  I would highly recommend Dr. Eades services.  He takes the time to explain the process and put you at ease.  ,Male
"I've been going to Dr. Eades for about two years now. 
My shoulder surgeon, who I hold in high regard, recommended Dr. Eades for the neck and back pain I had suffered from for many years.
My back and neck feel so much better and I wish I had done the breast reduction sooner.  
Thank you Dr. Eades for the beautiful job you did on my daughter and me. We are both very pleased w/the results. You gave my daughter her beautiful figure back &amp; you are keeping me looking much more refreshed and youthful.",Male
"Several years ago, I consulted with a very prominent Plastic Surgeon in Tucson about whether an under-eye lift would resolve the wrinkles that appeared there when I smiled. He told me that it would. I had the procedure done and it had no effect on my issue. Wish I'd gone to Dr. Eades first. He recommended the procedure that he thought would help, took a long time to explain the pros &amp; cons and explained why the under-eye lift didn't work. I am very happy with the results. Thanks Dr. Eades!",Male
I have had a face lift and a face peal. Unbelievably wonderful results! Have also used Dr Eases for fillers and have referred him to several friends. He’s the best!,Male
"Dr. Eades did reconstructive surgery on 37 year old encapsulated implants that no one else would go near.  His work was simply amazing.  I look better now at age 61 that I did in my 30s.  He is an extremely talented surgeon, and was also kind and patient throughout.  I haven't felt this comfortable with my body in decades.",Male
"12 Apr 2018  I saw Dr Eades for both upper eyelid surgery and full neck/face lift in March 2018.
Both surgeries produced much better than expected results and I'm now looking 20 yrs younger than 69..my appearance now matches my perception of my age and health.
Dr Eades even saw me on a Sat and Sun post-op to monitor my recovery..a superior surgeon and true gentleman with a great staff. I would recommend Dr Eades for safe and reasonable cost enhancements.",Male
"Dr. Eades is an excellent surgeon, but more importantly makes the patient feel relaxed and comfortable regarding medical  procedures.  I had a severe labial tear from childbirth and avoided having surgery for years due to fear of a “botched” procedure. The moment Dr. Eades greeted me, all my fears faded away. Surgery was a success and the recovery process has gone well due to the attentiveness and excellent bedside manner/follow-up care of Dr. Eades and his staff. I highly recommend him. ",Male
"Dr Eades is very personable, professional and his work is wonderful.   I have used his services a coupe times and highly recommend him. ",Male
originally scheduled surgery with another surgeon. After reading the reviews I was completely frightened!  I could not take the chance after reading a few negative reviews.  I did more research and found Dr. Eades. He was completely thorough in explaining the surgery and how it is done. He even showed me before and after photos .  I am 10 days post op &amp; so grateful I decided to go w/ him! Great surgeon. Caring/compassionate!,Male
"Dr. Eades is the best! I am a breast cancer survivor and my excellent surgeon Dr. Roeder referred me to this wonderful plastic surgeon! He has almost completed my breast reconstruction and I could not be happier! My husband agrees! Thank you, Dr. Eades, for making me feel human and beautiful again! --Hope",Male
Dr. Eades was recommended by my surgeon in Tuscon for breast reconstruction after having a double mastectomy.  He put me right at ease during this stressful time and explained how everything would go so I had no questions.  He and his office staff are so caring and professional.  I have just finished with everything so will not have to return to his office but will miss everyone there.  He is a wonderful surgeon and I had no problems with surgeries and follow ups.,Male
"Dr. Eades and his staff are compassionate, courteous and genuinely interested in my well-being.  He was recommended to me by my breast surgeon and I am forever thankful and grateful.",Male
"Perfect. Stellar surgeon! competent, lady friendly-what can I say professional all the way around. If I could give him a 10, I would.",Male
"Dr. Eades has been repairing my chest after a disastrous reconstruction by another surgeon in town. The initial diagnosis was devastating...but after one year and multiple surgeries Dr. Eades has been very successful in rejuvenating my chest making it possible to begin breast reconstruction. He is patient, kind, supportive, and an extremely talented and gifted surgeon. I am so blessed that this gifted surgeon had the generous heart to take me into his practice and help me become whole again.",Male
"I highly recommend Dr. Eades.  I am a complicated patient with multiple health issues.  He was able to quickly diagnose and treat me.  He is very knowledgable, listens to you and does what is needed.  Waiting time can be on time to waiting an hour or so.  But he is worth waiting to see.  ",Male
"I came to Dr. Eades as a person with no current complaints who wanted to establish a relationship with a local allergy doctor. I had suffered from environmental allergies in the past and wanted to make sure I had a doctor I could turn to if symptoms returned. Dr. Eades seemed charming and I thought the appointment went ok. Shortly after my initial appointment I received several bills from Southern Allergy &amp; Asthma, totaling approximately $1500, AFTER insurance coverage. I was dumbfounded and felt like the trust I put into him as a doctor had been broken. How could I owe that kind of money when I came in feeling fine and didn't need to change anything? Be very wary of this doctor and what you will be charged for. I did not feel comfortable being in his care and won't be returning.",Male
"We love Dr Eades! Friendly, professional staff and our allergies are so much better than before seeing him!",Male
Dr. Eades is extremely well versed and knowledgeable.  He takes time to listen and properly diagnose seemingly complex issues.  I would highly recommend him to anyone.,Male
Dr. Eades was extremely patient and attentive. He took the necessary time to diagnose my problem and scheduled me for a follow up appointment. I have been very pleased with my results and reccommend Dr. Eades for any allergy related symptoms.,Male
"I have been a  patient of Dr. Eades for over 15 years.  I chose him because of the recommendations of other physicians who considered him to be the most knowledgeable allergist in the Savannah area.  The most positive thing is that the medical issues I had were resolved because of his care and ability to diagnose the problem.  While I dread some doctors visits, it was always a pleasure to see him because he does take time to explain what is going on in the treatment and why.",Male
"I was greeted with an apology for him running late. Then it went downhill from there. His staff seemed frazzled and out of sorts, as he did. His demeanor was somewhat offensive. When questioned about my symptoms, he was very curt and almost seemed bothered with my response.  He was adamant about changing several medications while making unprofessional comments about the prescribing physician. The assistant that did the allergy test was obviously inexperienced resulting in 60 scabs a week later.",Male
Great doctor. Great staff. Finally my son has been correctly diagnosed and is getting the correct medication,Male
"I am so thankful to Dr. Eades and the staff of Southern Allergy and Asthma.  I have long suffered from Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (undiagnosed hives) and have been battling outbreaks over the last 30 years.  When I have a flare up, I get extreme hives- covering my entire body every day.  This fabulous doctor doesn’t give up when other allergists did!  He not only found a viable option to help- and then constantly documented and urged the insurance pharmacy to finally approve the specialty medi",Male
"This is not your every day doctors office.  Every single staff member was incredibly nice, sincere, and helpful.  Dr Eades did not rush me.  He listened to my issues and together we came up with a plan that worked to help me heal.  I definitely recommend this practice to anyone who is suffering from horrible allergies, asthma, or hives.  ",Male
I've been going to Dr. Eades for years and the relationship that we've formed both professionally and personally is one that I value highly. I only wish that the quality of his practice was the norm and not the exception to the rule.,Male
"Dr. Eades has been treating my daughter for her asthma and allergies for several years now, and has more recently been treating me for allergies. We have always found him and his staff to be caring and concerned for our well-being; found him to be knowledgeable and current in his field; and he is very respectful, personable and approachable in his demeanor. I highly recommend Dr, Eades and his staff at Southern Allergy and Asthma. ",Male

god complex,Male
The whole staff was great at northeastern obgyn.  I was provided with all instructions and paperwork prior to the appt.   They made sure I was well informed and provided me with all the necessary tools to make a well informed decision! The Vasectomy was painless and mistake free. once I got back to the procedure room I was in and out within 45 minutes.,Male
Super caring and friendly. Dr. Eades has great energy and asks questions in the perfect way! Great communication and my visit went by so fast! Totally took my mind off any anxiousness. Would definitely recommend him!!,Male
"He's pretty near to perfect, and the staff is good too. Since, I have anxiety issues, I choose my doctors wisely and continuously assess them over time. Dr. Eads and his staff has stood that test of time with me. I highly recommend him. He's knowledgeable, friendly, and ethical.",Male
"Though he has a busy practice, Dr. Eads met me in his office as a new patient to discuss my health background &amp; any any concerns I might have....a meet &amp; greet. I was so impressed &amp; it was very nice to be spoken to face to face, fully clothed, one on one, by my gynecologist. That was my first impression of Dr. Eads &amp; it was awesome! As an established patient, I've found Dr. Eads to be kind, concerned &amp; very knowledgeable. He greets patients like old friends, &amp; I'm always so comfortable with him.",Male
Dr Eads was my doctor for years before I moved . He is one of the best doctors I have ever been too. Very caring and always listens to you. I wish I still lived close to where he is since I have not found another OB/GYN like him,Male
"I was struggling to conceive &amp; friends recommended Dr. Eads.  After a few tests he put me on fertility meds. I was on them for 6 months before seeing a specialist.  At the specialist consultation I told them about meds my husband was on (which I had discussed with Dr. Eads), &amp; they immediately stopped me &amp; said we need to have my husbands sperm tested, because the meds were known to stop sperm production.  Tests said he was sterile-why did Dr. Eads not say something? Waste of my time &amp; money!!!",Male
I have been his patient since he took over my dr who retired. He has been a very good dr. One thing I have always liked about him is how he treats his patients. He seems genuinely concerned. All the females in my family use him and they all like him very much. ,Male
"Dr. Eads himself is a great doctor but his staff is awful.  A nurse rudely told me over the phone that my symptoms I was having was a miscarriage. Luckily ANOTHER doctor kindly got me in for a sonogram and my twins were just fine, it took Dr. Eads nurses over a day and a half to give me my blood results back that I was fine. So if I didn't have a back up doctor I would have had to wait over 24 hours to know if my babies were ok. Very unprofessional and no care for the patients feels.",Male
"Truth be told, he is a knowledgeable practitioner.  However, his bedside manner is lacking to say none the least.  I find that my appointments are very rushed and it feels like I am just burdening him when I ask questions.  I also do not feel that it is appropriate to comment on a pregnant woman's weight especially in the third trimester.",Male
"Dr.Eads is an absolutely amazing doctor. I recommend him to all of my family and friends. His staff is friendly and respectful. Nancy is by far the best nurse, she makes you feel very comfortable and always returns your phone calls. I just delivered my daughter three months ago,and Dr.Eads made my pregnancy comfortable and smooth. He is truly an amazing doctor and person. I can honestly say he cares about every patient he sees.  Thank you Dr.Eads.",Male
"Dr. Eads treated my husband.  She is amazing.  She Gave us 17 months of special time where others suggested hospice.  She is not only at the top of her field In Knowledge and expertise, she’s driven to beat cancer, and her heart is huge.  She defines compassion.",Female
"I recently had a hernia surgery.  Was referred to Dr. Eads.   Couldn’t be happier.   The process was smooth, his staff was amazing.   He took the time to tell me what he was going to do in terms that weren’t “medical jargon”.  He made sure I had ample chance to ask any questions or air any concerns.  The surgery went well and I am recovering comfortably.   Thanks Doc",Male
will not return a phone call ,Male
"Evidently we weren't worthy of her time. She'll treat him because he needs ECT treatments, but acts like she's doing us a favor by letting us be in her presence. ",Female
"My daughter was scheduled for treatments when this doctor unexpectedly and abruptly discharged her just 20 minutes after I registered a complaint, very nicely by the way, about one of the nurses. We had traveled a long way and spent a lot of money to get to the Univ. Of Arkansas hospital because the treatment my daughter needed was not available close to home. This was a devastating waste of time and money. I was crushed to return home with a sick child and  no options to help her.",Female
"Little to no bedside manner. Very little sense of humor. Did not feel comfortable with this physician. Her staff is mostly young and, in a few cases, unprofessional (i.e., laughing and talking loudly, playing music on a cellphone for the patients). There was also what would normally appear to have been a seasoned nurse... who handed me a questionnaire to fill out, in which she was supposed to ask the questions. ",Female
Dr Eads is always prompt and thorough.  Appreciate the fact we can get in and out quickly!,Male
Dr. Eads and his staff are phenomenal! They are very caring and genuinely concerned about helping people. I have been going to him for about a year now and my husband now also sees him.

"Me and my family have been going to Dr. Eads for years, I think at least a decade now.",Male
Excellent care regardless of the issue.,Male
I recently came into Dr. Eads office with my 6yr Daughter. She's been suffering from atopic dermatitis. After multiple Riley visits and other specialist I was still not any closer to what triggered  this. She was being put on meds that made her sleepy. She had seen a Dermatologist before seeing Dr. Eads this week. After speaking to him for a few minutes he immediately knew she was allergic to Nickel. I can't explain my relief to finally get an answer.   I have made him her primary Dermatologist.,Male
"I run a people oriented business which makes me very, very sensitive to customer/patient satisfaction. I am favorably overwhelmed with the friendly professionalism of every staff member I dealt with. Upon arriving the first time I received friendly smiles from everyone. In a relatively short time I was led to meet  Dr Eads whom I found immediately likable. He was very thorough and attentive to my needs and questions.  He has earned my not too easily given confidence.  I cannot be more satisfied.",Male
"I have been suffering with skin problems for years. I walked in took off my shirt and he said I can fix that! Then he did. I feel great, staff was swift and kind, nice environment in office, it was all great !",Male
"Fantastic experience !!! Quick and to the point,!!!! Took care of my problem in less than 5 min!! The man does not mess around, takes care of business and got me out fast.. The best part, PAINLESS!!! I will return if I ever have any more problems!!!",Male
"Why did I wait so long to do this???  I had several tag moles removed.  It was virtually painless, and I was in and out of the office in 15 minutes.  Great experience, and looking forward to my next appointment to get more of these unsightly things removed.",Male
"Appointment time was at 6:30AM and I was driving off by 6:35. Eads had a diagnosis and prescription in hand before even meeting me. I am a long time sufferer of acne, he didn't even look at my face or ask me what I had been prescribed before. He was very rude, had an attitude everytime I asked him a question. Never could get an explanation from him. Left his office with a script I've had before that doesn't work. I looked up the term he ""diagnosed"" me with, it's not even acne related.",Male
Just had what was the quickest and most thorough examination I've ever had in all my 57 years. Staff was extremely nice and professional and office was spotless. Dr Eads was a pleasure to meet and talk with was happy to find I at this time have no issues. Will recommend this facility to all who may need these services.,Male
"Dr. Eads and the entire staff at Greenwood Dermatology are the most efficient my wife and I have ever encountered:  timely, patient, great listening and diagnostic skills, extremely thorough and timely surgery.  Dr. Eads and staff make our visits the most pleasant of all our medical evaluations and treatments of our twenty-six year residency in Indiana.  

Dr. Eads is genuinely interested in patients' opinions and preferences for effective diagnostics, treatment and patient ease.    ",Male
"1st visit. Poor bedside manner. Little eye contact. Like others mentioned, it seems like an inconvenience that he has to even be in the same room. Diagnosed w/out asking any questions or even getting closer than 3 feet to me. No explanation of what to expect and snapped at me when I asked a question. I guess you can see more patients when your turn around time is approximately 5 minutes.",Male
"Dr. Eads is a very personable professional with a great mannerisms and attitude. He and his staff has awesome personalities and the service is faster than Jimmy Johns...no kidding! From the time I signed, being seen by the Doc I was out of the door probably 15 mins total (if that much). I wish all doctor offices would be mindful of your time like this staff.",Male
"I would not recommend 
Dr. Ead's to anyone. He was very rude, and I was only in his office for 3 minutes. When he quickly did a procedure to remove a squamous cell carcinoma, it took him a total of 3 minutes to get rid of it. As I was checking out he didn't ask me  if there were any questions and then immediately walked out. He did not explain anything. He treated me like I was dumb when I asked if there was any chances was it would affect eyesight.",Male
I've been to him two times now and will not return.  I am not sure how any Dr. can do their job properly without listening to the patient.  It would benefit him to slow down and listen to the patient.  I do not feel like my questions were answered.  ,Male
 I would give him a zero in bedside manner.  Everything was completely rushed.   No  explanation of anything unless I asked him  to explain.  Even then he made me feel like he was doing me a favor by explaining.   Time will tell if he was correct in his assessment of my situation.  It's a shame that he seems to look at patients as just a number.   Very disappointing. :(,Male
"He's concise to the point and very respectful 
the service was fantastic ",Male
"The office visits were rushed and the Dr. had an overall tone of sarcasm.  The art of effective listening was not at all used by the doctor with the patient and it even made the nurse in the room visibly uncomfortable, by viewing her nonverbal behavior.  The Dr. did not portray good customer service skills with his patient at any of the Dr. visits I was present for, and acted like the patient was an inconvenience.  This is unfortunate.",Male
"We understand that during the corona virus procedures have changed the hospital to no visitors- however, Dr. Eads gave our family member a terminal diagnosis while she was alone &amp; then was isolated from everyone.  What he did was cruel.  He could have called our hospital cancer navigators - but no.  He might have a brain but he has no heart.",Male
"Dr. Eads was courteous, fixed the issue, he is someone I would trust again. I did get  very sick about 5 days later and his physicians asst didn’t prescribe antibiotics and when I called back 2 additional days no one returned my call. I had a serious infection but was not taken seriously by the person taking the calls.  As it turns out, Dr. Eads had not been told that I had been calling. I think after that incident the staff response has probably been dealt with as he seemed very disappointed in hearing that I had been calling when I had my follow up with him. I don’t believe any of this was his fault but I do think his office staff let both Dr. Eads and myself down.  I really think he was genuinely upset that I went through what I did. May not have been his fault that I got it but it was his staff’s fault that no one took my calls seriously enough to let him know.  I would go back to him if I needed another surgery. I think the issue I had has likely been resolved.",Male
"Dr Eades did an incredible job with my husband's discectomy. We were referred to him while my husband was in extreme pain from a herniated disc, he met with us very quickly for the consultation and had surgery scheduled just as quickly! He was very honest and upfront with us as well as accommodating to all of our questions and extremely helpful in providing information and instructions.  The entire experience was pleasant and my husband feels wonderful after months of excessive pain.  ",Male
"After my automobile accident I had severe nerve pain and needed surgery on my spine.  Dr. Eads performed surgery and the results were excellent!!  He is an excellent surgeon, explained in detail about the pros and cons of surgery and what my options were.  Recovery time was smooth and I thank him and his staff for the professional service they provide.  If I ever needed surgery in the future, Dr. Eads would be the one I'd have do it. ",Male
"Very skilled, knowledgeable physician that takes time to explain things and is very attentive to our concerns.  Very compassionate.",Male
"He done my back surgery. And soon after I started noticing bad pain. I tried telling him something wasn't right. He continued to tell me everything is ok. After he proved he didn't care what I had going on. I went for a 2nd opinion. Sure enough they told me it all has to be redone. Nothing took. The screws are backing out and the cadaver bone didn't take either. So now,not only do they have to recut my back open. After that they have to cut my belly and go threw the front. Please don't use him.",Male
"Dr Eads performed a spinal lamectomy on 2/22/2018 after I was diagnosed with severe lumbar spinal stenosis.
He was professional and attentive, explained the procedure and what I should expect, offered alternative non-surgical options,
and was able to answer my questions fully.
His office was was able to schedule me quickly and the procedure was fully succesful.  I was without pain within a few days
and at 5 weeks post op my P.T. is going very well and my leg strength is returning.",Male
Totally dismissive. He missed a serious diagnosis of cranial instability &amp; didn’t even know what tests to order to see the problem. He has no interest in the spinal cord itself. I couldn’t be happier that his office offered me a 2nd opinion somewhere else. He just doesn’t listen to the patient.,Male
"I was referred here by my primary care doctor after having an MRI done. Dr. Eads zoned in on the problem and had a great solution. Unfortunately, he knew more than the doctor at my insurance company and he was not allowed to have the procedure covered by them. Hoping to take another stab at it. I have all the faith in the world in him.",Male
Failed to follow thru with diagnosis after two back surgeries. I felt as if he just dismissed my case.  Lack of compassion and professionalism.,Male
"I am a retired disabled veteran that was seen by Dr Eads for my spinal issues on several occasions.  His professionalism and medical expertise are superb.
His honesty in giving a medical opinion deserves 
a highest respect and I do recommend his medical services for those with spinal disk degenerative disease.

"I absolutely loved Dr. Eads. I was slightly concerned at first because I could find no reviews and because he seemed so young, but when he held my hand and prayed with me before surgery, I knew this was the right doctor for me.He spent probably 30 minutes explaining the surgery and the risks after the surgery with me.  He did a wonderful job on surgery, he answered every question I had and I would highly recommend him.",Male

"Under pressure to get preliminary tests for overseas spinal surgery, Dr. Eadula's staff got me in right away.  She ordered up all the requisite tests and prescribed meds so I'd be in the pink for the trip.  She is willing to do my follow up visits.  Many doctors are not supportive to patients seeking foreign medical care but Dr. Eadula has been a true ally.  ",Female
"I was under Eadys care for 31 weeks of pregnancy before I finally decided  I needed to change DR because my concerns over my health were not being cared for. She prescribed medication to me without so much notifying me of my health Issue or risk taking the medication at 31 wks or any other options I had, I also had to find out through Walgreens what health issue I had and any questions I had over the medication because I could not reach her or her assistant when I called into the office. Once I did receive a call back from her assistant I was met with a rude demeanor and none of my questions answered. Days after I go into the office to finally see Eady, I brought up my concerns and she decided it was more important to not hear me out and talk over me. She told me “you’re not the only patient I see” very disappointed, waited to long to transition care after multiple red flags before this issue. If you want to feel valued and cared for and not just another paycheck, find someone else.",Female
"I absolutely Love Dr. Eady?? She delivered my last two pregnancies and I can literally say she is the best, She gives you time, she is never rushed, she makes you feel so comfortable and explains every question and concern you might have??",Female
"I will never go back to this doctor. She gave me medication that has warning labels all over it not to take while pregnant without consulting your doctor about the risks, without telling me a single risk of the medication she gave. Upon calling the office, I was blocked by rude staff telling me they’d leave messages and she’d call me back, which never happened. After sending my husband into the office to get the risks, the office called my husbands’ job complaining about his behavior. I have never met a more unprofessional staff or doctor. Strongly do not recommend unless you like putting your unborn children at risk without knowing they’re at risk.",Female

I took my daughter to see Dr. Eady.. I have worked with doctors for years and I can honestly say this is one of the most compassionate and honest doctors I have ever met.

"Recently had new patient appointment with Dr. Eady. I thought she was very nice, personable, and knowledgeable. She took time to introduce herself, and answer any questions before the actual exam. She was not in a hurry, and did not rush me in my questions. I highly recommend Dr. Eady. ",Female
"This woman is very judgemental,  rushes you and makes you feel bad if you have a certain diet. I have never been so disrespected and so insulted by a doctor in my life. Her front office staff Monica is very nosey and needs to learn poker face and not jump to conclusions.  Be warned do not see this doctor she is the worst!",Female
Very nice and cares about your whole pregnancy.,Female
Dr Eady has also been great to me. ,Female
"Dr. Eady has been our family physician for almost twenty years. She is always kind, considerate and treats us like family. She is impressive in her knowledge and ability to treat whatever problems we have had. I love that she always treats us like real people.

"I was in need of an appointment that day. I called the office the gentleman handling the phones was exceptional helpful. The office was out and I told him my situation and later that day he had me hooked up with an appt over the phone with Dr Eady who isn’t my regular physician and was happy to help me out since mine was out. She was so nice and pleasant and listened to my problems. I asked her to try and get an MRI scheduled for me which she did. I was surprised I got a call next morning from imaging to schedule. I would definitely give her 5 stars and recommend her. It was a bad time for me and the office and she handled it very well.

"Listened, helpful, understanding.
Convenient appts.",Female
Dr Eady listened to and answered all my questions patiently and thoroughly.,Female
"I would NEVER recommend Christine Eady And she does t even deserve 1star--she was more concerned with her political posturing last year than her patients and missed (despite a golf ball sized tumor that was visible and easy to palpate as well as my multiple requests for ultrasound and/or biopsy--my cancer). She instead told me on 4 different occasions that I was ""just a tired mother of 3."" Our entire lives were worsened by her negligence, arrogance and sheer lack of concern for my welfare.

If you have any questions regarding the validity of this--check out her social media threads as ""Christine Mann"" she even admits that's she spends all her time and resources in the political arena (God help us that she not be elected) she is an absolutely abhorrent doctor--RUN in the other direction.

I also suggest looking at how long it has been since she received a positive review. I will be filing a formal complaint with the Texas department that regulates licensure.",Female
"I recommend avoiding this doctor if you have any other option. The visit was more unpleasant than the condition I went in for. Dr. Eady was incredibly rude and belittling. I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but there is no excuse for a doctor treating a patient this way. If you can go anywhere else, go anywhere else. The office staff was very nice, and it was easy to make a same-day appointment, but that wasn't enough to make up for how awful she made me feel. Doctors like this are why people die instead of going in for a check-up.",Female
"I've been going to Dr. Eady for years.  She's always been attentive, caring and competent.  She listens and works to find solutions.  She prescribes as necessary but doesn't over prescribe (doesn't throw antibiotics at a cold).",Female

"Dr. Eagan was professional, thorough, and informative. I always tend to get a bit anxious and she made the whole process a pleasant experience. Her nurse Rachel was also very kind and comforting.

"Absolutely the best. Smart, caring and efficient. Highly recommend.",Female

He is very knowledgeable, skilled, but most of all caring.  He always has time for his patients.  He is not only my cardiologist, after all these years I consider him my friend.",Male
"We had a negative inpatient experience with Dr. Eagan. First, I had to demand that he talk to me (after 2 days) about my father, whom I have POA. Then he walked in the room and stood with his back to me while talking to my father with dementia. I walked in front of him and explained I was the live in caretaker and he turned partially away from me! He was so rude and unprofessional. If he was my only impression of CVA, I would never step in that office.",Male
"I feel that I receive the best attention to my cardiovascular health via Dr. Eagan. He is open to listening to my concerns and provides clear answers to my questions.

The majority of the staff are very pleasant and thorough. ",Male

Also, hospital stay of 4 days and all the staff there were great!",Male
"Dr. Eagan fixed my broken pelvis after no one else in town would touch me and the ambulance took me to a different hospital first. Everyone I came into contact with who had knowledge of him had nothing but glowing things to say.  He put my mind at ease as soon as I met him. Although he did warn me that the surgery would be difficult and risky because of my age, his confidence gave me confidence.  I would recommend him to anyone who needs an expert orthopedic surgeon.",Male
"Dr. Eagan performed an emergency open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) surgery on my femur fracture in Feb 2016 at KMC. During the surgery, he made an unnecessary 8'' incision in my thigh which caused a propionibacterium acnes infection and led to my fracture becoming ""non-union"". After 7 months of no bone union, I had to have a second ORIF surgery with a different surgeon and was put on 3 months of antibiotics to clear the infection, which finally allowed my fracture to heal. Avoid!",Male
"We are so thankful for this doctor. My mother is elderly and had a fracture of her acetabulum and needed surgery. She was admitted to Memorial but needed a specialist.  A family friend recommended Dr. Eagan, so we called KMC and requested him by name. Fortunately, he accepted my mother for surgery.  It was a complex surgery, but my mom had no complications and made a full recovery. He is so humble and kind and generous with his time even though he is so busy. God bless him.",Male
I was referred to Dr. Eagan from another hospital to repair a fracture of my femur near my hip replacement. I was originally told that I would have to be transferred to LA to fix the break because it's a difficult surgery. Little did I know that an expert named Dr Eagan was right here in Bakersfield.  He fixed me the next day and I was home 2 days later. His bedside manner was excellent. Everyone at the hospital said he is the best and now I can say I agree.,Male

His work is of the highest quality and I would highly recommend him to anyone!",Male
"Part 2: I paid $12-13,000 on this surgery all for it to come out looking like crap. And feeling worse than I did before my surgery. He used pigskin to sew my abs back together. And for some reason my body isn’t taking a liking to it. I’m bloated almost all the time. My stomach still has loose flappy skin like I had before my surgery. And I’ve taken care of myself. I just look this bad because it wasn’t done right. He moved practices and hasn’t gotten ahold of me. They basically said “forget her” without actually saying it. I’m honestly so upset with my experience and I wouldn’t recommend. He won’t even get ahold of me and get me in to fix the issue. He’s throwing me on the back burner and ignoring me. Unprofessional as heck. If you wanna look worse than before and come out looking like dog crap I recommend. If you wanna actually look good and FEEL good, do NOT recommend at all.",Male
"Dr. Eagan is very professional. He did reconstructive surgery the same day as my breast cancer surgery.  He made me feel very comfortable during my consultation, pre surgery and post surgical recovery.

I would consider him for any and all plastic surgery work.",Male
"I can not say enough wonderful things about Dr Eagan!! He went above and beyond his call of duty and took such wonderful care of me in my darkest hours!! Without him I’m sure I wouldn’t be here.

His office staff are as equally top notch!!!",Male
"Dr Eagan performed my breast reduction recently and did a great job: From my initial consultation Dr Eagan put me at ease, clearly explained the risks and answered all of my questions. He has a great PA and his office did a great job working out the details with my insurance. I’m almost three weeks post op and the results are great: Thank you!! ",Male
"Disorganized office &amp; incredibly arrogant doctor. Waited literally an hour in his office for my consultation, but I still agreed to have surgery.  Paid deposit, waited several days for staff to call and schedule my surgery.  When someone finally called, I realized she didn't actually know what surgeries were being done. I was appalled at their disorganization, so I asked that Dr. Eagan call me, so that we could go over everything.  He called, but he was arrogant and dismissive.  No thanks.",Male
"Dr. Eagan performed surgery on me this week and everything went perfectly. The stitching is perfect, I'm up walking around in minimal pain from the procedure but best of all, it looks amazing.

Terrible!! My husband's hand was broken.. the first available app they could give was 10 days out.they had 10 is to let me know that  their private practice so they expect the estimated insurance amount to be paid out of pocket by the patient before being seen in their office and having a credit card on file for any unforeseen expenses or not covered amounts.. Terrible to not let u know ahead of appt.. so my husband was not seen bc he went there directly from work without their requirements,Male

"Dr.
 Eagen cared for my husband in 1998.  He was the ONLY Doctor who figured
 out that my husband had a heart problem, &amp; needed  Coronary  Artery
 Bypasses. Dr. Eagen met with me daily in the hospital to discuss my 
husband's care &amp; what medications he ordered for him &amp; why. My 
husband had 9 Doctors, but I put Dr. Eagen in charge. My husband 
recovered then, but weeks later,he suffered 3 strokes during the night. 
 Dr. Eagen was away then, but came IMMEDIATELY upon his arrival home 
&amp; got my husband into Intensive care. Later on, he watched over my 
husband &amp; visited him often at Allied.Long term care center.  He was
 the BEST Doctor my husband ever had !  Sadly, my husband passed away 6 
weeks later &amp; Dr. Eagen came to the funeral home VERY upset . We had
 NO idea why my husband died. Dr. Eagen told me to get all the records 
to find out.  After 5 years we found out medications were doubled at 
Allied, &amp; a heavy sedative at the hospital stopped my husband's 
heart .  5  Star Rating !",Male
"While Dr. Eager came highly recommended for his bedside manner and care, I found him to be aloof and non caring.  The procedure did not work and he nor his staff seemed to care.  The procedure was more like a factory setting as the nurses joked about how many procedures he tried to do in a day.  He knew during the procedure there was an issue, yet never acknowledged his error or even spoke following the procedure.  He had to move on to the next patient.    I am an otherwise healthy man with sciatica issue that has been debilitating to regular activity.  I am now seeing someone in a different practice who truly has a goal to work with me to restore my health.  While I realize Doctors cannot help everyone, or the level of relief is patient dependent.  I find Dr. Eager's care and concern disappointing at best. ",Male

"Even though this review is years ago, Dr Eager saved my mum, Bettejean from years of pain. She put off knee replacement but when she did seek help Dr. Eager gave her the best outcome! She could not wait to have her other knee done. No more pain! Before the surgeries her legs were severely bowed the difference was fabulous not just physically but more importantly mentally. Dr. Steven Eager is the best in our book. 5 stars are not enough...",Male
"Worst, laziest physician I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  It's Synthroid or nothing with this guy. He truly could not care less if it doesn't work.  The good news is if you disagree with him he will just ""discharge you from the practice"" and backfill with the next victim!",Male

"Narcissist, controlling, manipulative, this woman is a nightmare",Female
Very flighty talks more than clients and irritatingly slow. Charges a hefty price asks people to come weekly not sensitive not compassionate not responsive.,Female
Dr Eagle took care of me when I ended up in icu with respiratory failure. I’ve never been so scared in my life! It’s true that people can hear what’s going on around them while they’re on life support. She treated my family as tho they were her own and she never hesitated to help me with whatever I needed help with! My only complaint is that she doesn’t have a private practice!,Female

"Dr.  Eagles is the south shore's best kept secret!  I first saw her for a hip problem after 6 months of PT with no improvement.  After a couple of visits, and by keeping up with the exercises she gave me to correct my problem, my pain is gone.  After a recent accident, I went back to see her.  Once again, Dr. Eagles has set me on the path that will allow me to pursue the physical activities that I love today while preserving my mobility for the long run.  I highly recommend Dr. Eagles!",Female

That skill-set combination results in an unusual ability to develop a targeted highly effective and methodological sports' medical  therapy protocol.  I experienced precise and effective interventions. She has efficiently and successfully treated each of my conditions! I refer my patients to her. Dr. CM",Female
"I’ve seenDr. Eagles for 2 treatments related to headaches &amp; neck/back stiffness. I found her to be one of the most thorough, patient and skilled health professionals I’ve had the pleasure to work with. She was extremely knowledgeable, answered all my questions &amp; explained each step in my treatment  process. The therapies she performed were not only effective for what I came in for, but also have improved my bilateral chronic carpal tunnel, a condition that’s been virtually untreatabl for years.",Female
"Dr. Eagles is first rate - she is compassionate, thorough, highly skilled and a wonderful communicator. She has squeezed me in on many occasions and always brings excellent results. She is the only one I would trust with my shoulder and knee. I highly recommend her to all of my friends and family and feel extremely grateful to have her on my team. Outstanding professional.",Female
"I have been seeing Dr Eagles for many years. Her care to her work and her patients is above all others. She takes the time to treat your condition as well as educate on it. 
I highly recommend her to all my friends and family. ",Female
"Dr Eagles has been treating me for years for my hip pain. When other orthopedist told me to quit my job and get a desk job and start using a cane she took the time to properly diagnose me and helped me get better. 
Always willing to make the time to see me if I’m having any problems. 
Has helped me with many other problems too. 
Dr Eagles is very sweet and extremely smart. Always willing to take the time to explain things. I highly recommend her.  ",Female
"Very personable, efficient, and informative.  Better at injecting my knee than my orthopedist was. I highly recommend her and have sent her friends and family.",Female

  I have never had a long wait to see her because she has been efficient and very good at keeping appointments in a timely fashion.",Female
"I have been to Dr. Eagles several times for shoulder issues. I never waited more than a few minutes. Dr. Eagles was warm and attentive, and her access meant as well as treatment were very helpful in dealing with my problem. I have already sent  friend to her, and will continue to recommend her highly. ",Female
Cold personality. usually runs far behind. Did not find her to be helpful.,Female
"Cold, doesn't explain anything. Almost has an attitude. ",Female
Dr. Eagleson diagnosed and originally treated my prolactinoma. I found her to be kind and caring and was very grateful to have her on my side!,Female
"I was switched to Dr. Eagleson when Dr. William Evans retired.  While Evans was extremely knowledgeable about PCOS, caring &amp; willing to answer questions, Eagleson comes across as unknowledgeable, uncaring &amp; unhelpful. She answered 99% of my questions about PCOS, insulin resistance, &amp; Metformin with ""Doctors just don't know."" Dr. Eagleson also made it very clear she was unwilling to treat the resulting infertility that comes with PCOS. UVA, please hire a more suitable replacement for Dr. Evans.",Female
"Only goes by blood tests, didn't even do the one that was high on me previously. Waited over an hour and she spent 5 minutes with me. Very disinterested in you when in room. One tube of blood and three tests now I owe UVA over $300 with no answers and no medication to help me.",Female
She is trustworthy and takes the time to explain my medical problem and choices in treatment.  Highly recommend her.,Female
"She doesn't listen and only goes by blood test results instead of how you feel.  If the blood tests are in the normal range, then she blows off your concerns.  In addition, she does not offer any suggestions to help you.  Instead, I had to research my own disease and suggest tests to her which came back as needing attention.  I will be switching doctors.",Female
Does not spend enough time with you.  Brushes off concerns.  Does not explain answers to questions.,Female
"Dr. Eagleson was awesome. He took a long time with us to explain everything that was going on, and he did it in a way that was easy to understand. You can tell he really loves his job and cares deeply about his patients.",Male
Excellent bedside manner...very knowledgeable...allows patient interaction with questions...,Male
Happy to have been able to get Dr. Eagleton to do my surgery. ,Male
"Dr. Eagleton is brilliant, kind, compassionate, and caring.  I have been seeing him since 2010 every 4-6 months.  It is because of Dr. Eagleton that I am still alive.  He takes wonderful care of me.  If you ever have the need for a pulmonologist, getting Dr. Eagleton is like winning the lottery !!",Male
Eaglin doesn’t listen to my issues and only tells me to “hang in there.”  I am very depressed and we speak by phone once every three months and he refills my meds. I wouldn’t recommend him.,Male
Does not respond to emergencies.,Male
"I was weary of young doctors but not anymore. He knows all the new literature, techniques, and medicines. A bit weird that he uses a computer instead of a notepad but it’s the new way. He’s very attentive and although quiet, very helpful. Tested my enzymes immediately finding that I wasn’t breaking down my medication (which I was on for decades) and once he found one my body could accept, my whole life changed to sooo much better. Kind and patient desk staff. Making an appointment is kind of slow, but good doctors are busy. I appreciate all he’s done to turn my life around.",Male
"This is not a good psychiatrist.  He does not listen well and is not good at getting to know a patient’s history or even seeming to develop a connection.  In addition, he spends the time telling a patient how to eat and exercise, rather than developing thoughful approach to a patient’s current situation.   He seems to be more of a nutritional coach than a board certified psychiatrist. Go elsewhere...not worth the time or money to deal with mediocre quality.  ",Male
"This is one of the few Psychiatrist in Jacksonville who is not about just money.  He cares about his patients, is very non judgemental,  and I would recommend him to anyone seeking the care.",Male
"He is not oriented to the patient. Once he makes up his mind to something, that is it. ",Male
Very great. She listens and resounds with options of. solutions with clear intentions,Female
"Dr. Eagon is THE BEST!!!!
PERIOD!!!!...??????
Dr. Eagon, I have ""2 words""
THANK YOU!!!!??????
I totally disagree!!! that he is unreachable, or he doesn't see his patients...
Yes, he is a busy, ?? but when you are Good! You are going to be busy...????
Again, Thank you Dr. Eagon!!!!",Male
"Would NEVER recommend Dr. Eagon to anyone and would absolutely recommend finding another doctor.  He is all about money, does not listen to his patients, does not care what his patients think or if they are in pain.  Very forceful with his decision for your treatment without any input from patient.   It was just a horrible experience.   I have been to many doctors in my life for mostly injuries from sports and he was just the worst, by a long shot. STAY AWAY",Male
"I have total confidence in his surgical ability. However, don't expect to see him much before or after the surgery. You'll be under the care of a nurse unless you have complications. Dr. Eagon has a very busy practice and it is difficult to get on his surgical calendar.",Male
"He was competent, professional, kind, considerate. I had a procedure done at NKC Hosp Pavillion.  All went well and I thank you Doctor Eaker.",Male
"Excellent listener and diagnostician. He does not give up when a diagnosis is difficult and pursues testing until he finds the cause of the patient's problems.
A friend recommended Dr Eaker, based on her own experience (nurse and patient). I'm glad I listened. I walked out of the first meeting with Dr Eaker with a  feeling of hope after other doctors had given up. ",Male
Like that he is a Christian and seeks the will of God over going with financially gainful procedures. Great bed side manner and does not discriminate due to class.,Male
He was the best doctor I had. He made the experience of giving birth so much easier than I had planned in my mind. I was less scared and knew my baby and I were in good hands. He has really good bed side manners. Overall a genuinely nice guy who does his job well! ,Male
"Combine excellence in the field with a genuine compassion for her patients, and this sums up the practice of Dr. Eaker.  I had breast cancer requiring some pretty significant surgery.  I can't say enough about the myriad of ways she supported me.  In my humble opinion, there is no better surgeon to have in your corner.",Female
"Dr. Aeker is sweet and she care my daughter Kiley for 14 years now, thanks Dr.",Female
She is both my children's doctor and she is amazing! She listens to your concerns and never judges. I love that she is a mother of little ones so I know she relates. She makes you feel comfortable. ,Female
Dr. Eaker is the most caring and experienced doctor I've ever had. I would trust him with any problem I had. His manner is caring and his knowledge exceeds expectations. I would recommed anyone to him. He is fantastic. ,Male
"My 2 year old and 6 month old are patients of Dr. Eakes. He is absolutely wonderful. Very kind, courteous, and soft spoken. He is always very thorough when examining my children. Even though I know he is very busy, he always takes his time. Great doctor and I highly recommend!",Male
"Had some chest pain, went to the ER, was seen promptly by Dr. Eakes and even though it ended up not being something serious, he took me very seriously the entire time and explained everything extremely well and answered all my questions. Even though he probably had patients way more urgent than me, he never made me feel stupid or foolish for coming in.  If he was a regular office Dr. there's no one I'd rather see.",Male
"Treated for the  same health concern for 1 year with no results. I was forced to  see another health care provider to get proper treatment. Also, ""Dr Eakes office charged me $15 for each referral I requested.",Male
"Dr. Eakin shows a genuine concern for her patients , spends a lot of time as an active listener, and provides sound medical advice. For years I had struggled with my condition that seemed to rule my life (I hold myself partly culpable but also attribute it to prior medical mismanagement). She has effectively gotten my condition under control and I feel healthier than ever. Thank you, Dr. Eakin!",Female
"Spends a lot of time interacting with the patient, which is conducive to being a great diagnostician. Her nutritional knowledge is a welcome change to the prescription pad. ",Female
I've seen Dr. Eakin for shoulder pain twice and was very pleased with my treatment.  He did a thorough exam and suggested several different options.,Male
"I walked into a subacromial decompression surgery this morning practically begging Dr. Eakin  to cancel the surgery because I was convinced my shoulder was all better. He patiently listened, and then told me with confidence and kindness that he felt the surgery was the right choice based on my MRI and his experience with both my shoulders over the past year and a half. His knowledge and instinct were spot in. The damage was even more severe than shown on the MRI. There were tears in the rotator cuff, bicep tendon, labrum, and ligament. The intruding bones had left their mark and I am so grateful to Dr. Eakin that he caught this and made the necessary repairs with care and precision as well as remove the underlying threat of future damage. I always know I am in excellent hands with Colin Eakin. He has been a Godsend to me and both of my shoulders. I am forever grateful. Thank you. Thank you.",Male
"Although Dr Eakin was scheduled until the end of the year, he took the time and made room to see me.  I start the Police Academy (at age 48) in March.  He was able to see and access my knee.  His wonderful scheduler, Linda, worked my surgery in and I was additionally pleased with Dr Eakin as a man of faith and his convictions.  I will be referring my family and friends to him.",Male
"Dr. Eakin, has provided Excellent care for our child.  She is the Best!",Female
"Dr. Eakin is very thorough, competent with a great bedside manner. I highly recommend him and his entire team for bariatric surgery. ",Male
"I had a family member admitted into the hospital for cholelithiasis and was taken over care by Dr. Eakin. He was in minimal pain but tests showed he needed a cholecystectomy. Dr. Eakin insisted he stay and the surgery would happen. He never met my family member but kept sending in his PA. After 3 days, Dr. Eakin said never mind and discharged him and said surgery in a week. We went in a week later at scheduled time, 6am and were turned away. I dont doubt his abilities but bad customer service",Male
Dr.eakin is a miracle worker he saved my life he is the best doctor I have ever been to,Male
I recommend Dr. Eakin to anyone needing an excellent and compassionate surgeon. On a scale of 1 -10 (1 being the lowest) I would give him a 20!  He gave me back a quality of living that I never thought I would have again. Wonderful man. I would highly recommend him to everyone.,Male
"I have met with her on three occasion. I find that she takes the time to listen and answer all the questions you may have. Her answers are for the layman, she makes sure you understand both your condition and the treatment. She does all of this with humor while addressing your concerns.",Female
Dr. Eakin has been my primary physician for over 20 years.  His diligent medical services has caught cancer in its early stages twice.  I trust him with my life.,Male
"He has been my physician for 30 years. Very knowledgeable, willing to take time to listen, never feel like he's rushing me.",Male
"My husband and I have been going to Dr. Eakin for 20+, there is no better doctor than him in the whole midwest. He is very compassionate, kind, trust worthy, caring, and most of all, has the best knowledge in his medical field. I would recommend Dr. Eakin to all. I give him a 10+ rating in all catagories.",Male
"I have been seeing Dr. Eakin at the Veterans Affair Hospital (VA) in NYC for the last 6 months. She is extremely intelligent, quick witted, very personable and proactive. I have seen many doctors in the VA within the last 20 years and I find Dr. Eakin to be an AMAZING  psychiatrist and an even better person. She is so caring and thoughtful when I talk to her in our sessions about my problems, always listens attentively, giving me her undivided attention and regularly comes up with a solution to my problem rather quickly. I definitely think she can be very intimidating to someone that is not used to dealing with such a strong, assertive, super intelligent woman. I appreciate her honesty and her bedside manner which is always positive, uplifting and pleasant. Dr. Eakin stands apart in my opinion from other psychiatrists because she is that rare breed of super intelligent, very personable, genuine in her concern of your well being and has common sense. I highly recommend Dr. Marion Eakin.",Female
"I got the feeling that this doctor only wanted a good career but had no real feeling for the work. She was smart enough to get into Harvard but didn't really have a feel for her patient not 
 cared to either.  I'd take a full pass on this one",Female
Dr. Eakins was thorough and explained my MRI results in detail while conducting a physical exam to determine the best treatment path for me.  As a former college athlete I have been dealing with chronic pain for many years and I have seen several doctors over the past decade alone to compare and I would absolutely recommend Dr. Eakins.,Male
READ ANOTHER PATIENTS MRI RESULT INSTEAD OF MY OWN.  NOT FOCUSED ON MY ANSWERS.  ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES.  DID NOT SCHEDULE PROCEDURES CORRECTLY OR AT ALL. ,Male
Excellent surgeon!,Male
"Dr. Eakins is absolutely wonderful!  His bedside manner is phenomenal and level of care of rare these days!   His staff is great, too!   I would not hesitate to schedule my next surgery with him!    ",Male

great doctor!  ,Female
"Dr. Eakle is one of the best doctors I’ve ever seen. I started seeing her in January 2020 &amp; within she figured out what was wrong with me that my prior doctor didn’t get after 4 yrs of treating me. She is a very kind hearted woman with AWESOME BED SIDE MANNERS!!!! If your not a patient of hers, your not being treated by a good doctor",Female
Dr Eakle is a compassionate and highly capable doctor.  I'm 64 and have seen a lot of Doctors in my time and she is easily the best that has ever treated me.  She is the complete package.  Staff is great as well.  They are always busy but willing to work you in if you need to see her.  Absolutely the best in this region.,Female
Dr. Eakle is very thorough and thoughtful. She makes you feel at ease as soon as she enters the door. She is one of the best physicians I have ever been too. I would strongly recommend her! Her entire staff are all top notch and caring!,Female
"She is extremely intelligent, but with that, she brings compassion &amp; she tries her best to help the patient understand why the body isn't working the way we need it to. When we understand how to fix a problem, &amp; a professional like Dr Eakle explains how we can personally address our health, it is difficult to go to the fast food type doctor again. She puts the care back in Medical care &amp; most of us want to know our doctor actually cares for our health &amp; show us how to get healthy again.",Female
Old fashioned doctor who will spend as much time as you want with you answering questions and explaining things.  Very thorough.  You will wait but it is because of the time she spends with you and not due to overbooking appointments.,Female
Performed emergency 3xbypass and basically saved my life..,Male
"Great Dr., saved many lives, G--D bless him",Male
"Dr, Mark Ealovega is a first rate provider.  Knowledgeable , articulate, compassionate and a good listener.  His support staff is not great, though.  I received no follow up from telephone inquiries about appointments, despite promises to get back to me within a specific period of time and, subsequent to that, poor follow up when I contacted them again.  I am no longer waiting on a response from Dr. Ealovega's sub-standard office staff.   I have moved on to another, more professional office.",Male
He is a great Dr. but in a system that is always fully booked and nearly impossible to get an urgent appointment or one within the next month or two!  Sometimes another provider can be seen but only after waiting for a return call from a nurse who must triage your symptoms first. Sometimes they tell you to go to any urgent care as there are NO appointments in the near future. It is a big hassle. ,Male
"Dr. Fa are the best, she has taken care of me for many years, can't say enough.",Female

"I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Jill Faatz for the past 10 years.  She has been my primary physician and I consider her one of the very best doctors I have ever been to.  I regard her highly and have recommended her to many of my friends.   She is very caring and really listens to her patients.  I get results from my annual exams within a day or two, and she takes the time to hand write additional notes for me.  I sincerely appreciate her!",Female
"Awful. Experience is quite lacking, Daughter of a doctor but she shouldnt be a doctor, she pays more attention to the latest fashion than the medical field.",Female
"Talk about a true and compassionate doctor.
Dr. Fababe took the time to listen to my concerns about an upcoming possibly life changing procedure I was about to have and sat with me talking to me as I was part of her family which really calmed me down and put me at ease knowing I was in good hands with Dr. Fababe and the Cleveland Clinic team’s best interest in my well being and road to recovery.
I can’t thank her enough For her professionalism and compassionate qualities she exhibits towards her patients.",Female

Have seen Dr. Fabbri for 11 years and she always take the time to listen and if I have questions she take the time and effort to make sure I understand the answer. You feel that she care for you as a patient and that's not so common these days,Female
"Dr. Fabbri performed a complex surgery that not only spared my leg but saved my life. He is thoughtful, knowledgeable, thorough and precise. His entire staff is capable and professional. When you undergo surgery, you have to put your life in someone else's hands. Once I met Dr. Fabbri, I immediately felt at ease and knew I could trust him with my case. ",Male
"He is incredibly caring. He may have an early start and a full slate of seeing patients and doing surgery, but every time I would see him, he would calm and patient and acted like I was the only person he was seeing for a check up all day. Great sense of humor and super knowledgeable but he's at the absolute best institute for cancer in the world. Visited me after each of my surgeries after he had a long day of operating. Great Great guy! ",Male
"There is no need to discuss Dr. Fabbri's professional knowledge as a physician because working for one of best institutions in world, he certainly is equipped with superior technical skills. What is impressive about him is his work ethic and care for patients. I had the chance to watch him after a long day of surgeries showing up in the room of the patient at 8 in evening to see how he was doing after his long surgery. This does not happen often today. Reminiscent of good old medicine in new era",Male
Extremely bright and well spoken doctor. Every session  is quality time. One of the best doctors I have had in my life. ,Male
"Dr. Fabbri is the best physician I ever treated with.  He is very knowledgeable in all aspects of medicine, not just psychiatry.

I'm grateful to be in his care &amp; know that my life is better because of him.  He is one of a kind &amp; simply the best!",Male
"Dr. Fabbro is knowledgeable, friendly and truly concerned about her patients. I highly recommend her. The office staff, though, is sorely lacking. They're a nightmare to deal with. Always have issues with refills not being submitted properly, or in a timely manner. Paperwork has been ""lost"". It recently took me 4 days and 8 phone calls to get a prescription submitted, after giving the MA the name and number of my pharmacy at an office visit. Unbelievable. And yes, I did, lose patience and tell them they were dumb*$$#$. The Pope would have lost patience with this crew.",Female
"Dr. Fabbro is an excellent doctor. She listens well, and is thorough  in her examination. I had some lesions that needed to be frozen off and she was gentle in performing the procedure. I've been to a few different dermatologists  over the years and Dr. Fabbro is the best one I've seen.",Female
"Dr. Fabbro probes with many questions and once my answers were given exhibits incredible care and attention to every detail when providing explanations for treatment.  I always leave her office feeling perfectly confident that I am in the “best of the best” care.  There is a genuine concern for my wellness, and I consistantly feel at ease and never rushed.  Her human side and professionalism is clearly evident.  As a result, I have referred my family &amp; friends to her extraordinary expertise!!",Female
" Dr. Fabbro is a breath of fresh air at a time when most doctors rush you in and out of their office. She is extremely knowledgeable and caring and takes the time to  get to know you and understand your concerns. My entire family sees her for our yearly mole checks and my daughter and I see her for our acne. She tried several different approaches to address my adult acne and I can now say for the first time ever in my life, I can go without make up to the grocery store if I want!
She’s the best!",Female
"Excellent doctor's office experience; from the ease of check-in and a very short wait, all of the staff were polite and efficient.  My daughter and I had first-time appointments several hours apart.  When Dr. Fabbro saw that, she offered to combine our appointments to see the two of us at the same time.  I felt she valued my time as much as her own (not what I have experienced in the past with doctors).  At the same time, she was both professional and personable.  I highly recommend Dr. Fabbro.",Female
I would absolutely recommend Dr Fabbro. She is not only knowledgeable but  she also has great bedside manner. I really appreciate the great job she has done and continues to do working to fix my health issue. I have a rare disorder in addition to my skin issue that seems to causing extra frustration in trying to get the skin issue under control. She has worked with me patiently and seems to have done a lot of research in order to come up with the best solution. ,Female
Dr. Fabbro has treated my mycosis fungoides for about a year and has always been very helpful and patient throughout this ordeal.  She has always been able to see me when the need arises and I feel I am in very capable hands.  She has always answered my questions and taking the time to explain all options of medical care.,Female
"Dr. Fabbro is kind, patient, and friendly. I like her and her staff. She has a great manner about her. She is very poised. ",Female
"Dr Fabbro is a really nice Doctor. I barely waited at all, her assistant got my right back into the room and the doctor was in within 5 minutes. I had a visit for acne and she gave me a pill and a cream to take for that. The acne is almost completely gone and she was really happy to see me back with my improvements. Would definitely return.",Female
Very poor bedside manner and not a knowledgeable doctor. Misdiagnosed a condition that another doctor easily diagnosed correctly. I missed a lot of work because of her. Always runs late to appointments as well.,Female
Very caring and understanding.  Explains everything VERY WELL!  Speaks to you in an understandable language!,Female
"Doctor Fabela and his nursing staff are the best I have ever had. They have always been super attentive, caring, professional, and extremely thorough. I will follow him anywhere he goes! It is my hope that the other doctors and staff know what a great addition he is to any team! I cannot express how much I appreciate him and all of his nursing staff for all that they do! I would recommend him to everyone I know!",Male
Great experience with Dr Fabela.  My whole family can not say enough positive things about this man.  He is very caring and thorough.  He listens to you will do his best to make you feel comfortable talking with him.  We will be following him to his new location.,Male
"Dr. Fabela is caring, very thorough and he listens. He is always on time and the staff is very friendly.  He follows through and after seeing him he follows up to check on yo. Great doctor.",Male
"Dr. Fabela is prompt, professional, and and I felt that he genuinely listened to my concerns and took care of my family.  Would recommend him to anybody looking for a good family doctor.",Male
Great Doctor!   Love this new model of care.  He spent over an hour with me going over all my concerns and lab results!  Also I got the labs for my physical the same day!  This is the future of medicine!,Male
"His approach to my concerns was terrible. Attitude and actually laughed. Left there with no answers, so glad I went to another doctor, bloodwork was done, suspicions confirmed, and my problems fixed. ",Male
"I had a great experience, although short, with Dr. Fabela.  He spends a great deal of time with you and makes sure you understand test results clearly.  Sorry he left the Clearfork office.  Does anyone know where he went?  I would definitely switch offices to continue seeing him.",Male
I saw Dr. Fabela for the first time for a yearly checkup. I was pleased with the time he spent with me and did not feel he was in a rush. He will be my primary physician as well as my husband's. ,Male
"Made an appt in Dec, then I got a call that Dr. had an emergency and would return in January so made an appt in January.  He seemed very nice, concerned, thorough.  Follow up appt made in April and the day before received a call that he could not see me that day and to reschedule so I had to reschedule for following week.  My husband made an appt and that morning they called to say Dr. had emergency.  Also gave cell # to call if emergency, called one night left text, never returned call or text.",Male
"Great doctor,  very thorough and answered all questions.  He has been only doctor to get my diabetes under control.  Can't recommend him enough ",Male
"Great Doctor, Always answers questions and addresses concerns.  Has helped my and my family, who he also sees numerous times. Would highly  recommend. ",Male
"Dr. Fabela was excellent!!  He made me feel comfortable, took his time and explained everything to make sure I understood.  His staff was really helpful and friendly.  The only thing I didn't like was the MCNT's front desk person; she was not friendly and wasn't really helpful.  She seemed to be in a bad mood.",Male
"Dr. Fabella is the kind of dr that is very comfortable to talk too, very humble and kind. he makes sure his patient is healthy. he does whatever he can to make sure we surely stay healthy me, my husband and our son. He's the best doctor I ever had since I came here in the U.S.",Male
I absolutely love Dr. Fabella.  He genuinely cares for his patients and is very understanding and patient.  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a doctor in his field of expertise.,Male
"Dr. Fabella is not only an excellent provider but also a carring doctor. When it comes to his patients bedside manners there is no doctor like him. He takes the time to listens to his. patients, without seeming to be in a hurry.  He is the kind of individual that has a big heart.",Male
Excellent friendly manner. He tries to find out any issues and is very  thorough in his questions and exams. My wife and I both go to him and are both very satisfied.,Male
Dr Fabella thought it appropriate to exhibit disrespect through belittlement and laughing at my efforts to find a cause for an on-going medical condition.  That is an obvious violation of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics.   A referral to a specialist resulted in no specific diagnoses or follow up as I continue to experience unpleasant medical symptoms.,Male
"She is an excellent dr.  I appreciate how she explains to you medications, conditions etc.  Her staff is excellent as well.  Very welcoming, friendly and they genuinely care about your well being.   This is the first doctor that I don't feel anxious about my visits!  The only draw back is the wait time can be long.  But I think she is well worth it!",Female
"The first time I saw Dr. Gamiao I waited over an hour and a half. I thought maybe it was a fluke because they scheduled me somewhat urgently/ last-minute. The second time I saw Dr. Gamiao, I again waited for almost two hours. Same with the third. My fourth appointment was my last appointment because I have a life outside of waiting rooms - I couldn't take it anymore. Dr. Gamiao herself is sweet and knowledgeable.  The office staff is outrageously rude... in person and over the phone. ",Female
"The wait time for this practice is RIDICULOUS!  I routinely waited 1-1 1/2 hours for short (once it was  a 7 minutes--yep, I timed it once) appointment.
The office staff is a nightmare.  They are rude, abrupt, and unhelpful from my experience. 
Dr. Gamiao is knowledgeable, but distracted.  She often had a student with her and spent more time explaining my condition to the resident than she did talking to me.  I was so frustrated with the care and lack of progress that I left the practice.",Female
"Great doctor,  below average office staff. The wait times are ridiculous every time I go. She is very personable which I appreciate but they need to schedule her with longer apt times. I usually wait an hour  to 90 minutes to be seen at minimum.   The office staff is very, very slow to respond to your questions.",Female
"worst doctor ever, wrong diagnosis wrong medication without even any imaging. Had blood work done in December and now it's March still waiting for a call but finally went to my PCP and got all my results which needed more testing and different medication. Every time I ask her a question she would always say I don't know so what exactly does she know!!!!!! Do not recommend at all .....be careful please",Female
"Dr. Gabello-Gamiao is wonderful!!!  However, you do have to wait for her, but it's because she genuinely cares about each patient and takes the time to answer questions and to go over test results.  I do get frustrated with the wait times, but I would rather wait for an EXCELLENT doctor then have no wait for a crappy one. ",Female
"I called office, spoke to Anna.  I explained that I want specific blood work done.  She advised me the DR will do the tests she wants done, not what I (THE PATIENT) wants done.   Anna basically talked me out of setting an appointment with this DR!  
I would have at least like a chance to set an appointment with the DR to get her advice.  Clearly Anna makes these decisions for her.  I will continue to shop for an endocrinologists.",Female
Dr Fabelo is a great doctor who listens and always answers your questions.  I think him and his staff are the I have been to at baycare.,Male
" I feel like the scheduling staff is very poor. I feel like the doctor knows what he's doing  but needs to take a good look at his staff

"During your appointment, she answers text messages and phone calls. My last meeting (which resulted in not continuing with her) someone knocked on the office twice and she left twice, leaving me alone crying while trying to talk of my situation. She came back and immediately ended the appointment without acknowledging my emotional state. ",Female
"The best of the best!  Dr. Fabens is endlessly compassionate, kind, patient, and brilliant.  Really the only problem with her is...there isn’t enough of her, and she can’t be cloned.  It can be very, very hard to get in to see her (the trick is just show up, and wait in the lobby until she is available—which can be a while, or wait for an appointment).  On the plus side, all the providers in this practice are excellent, and they allow walk in appointments—thank heavens!",Female
Dr. Fabens is really smart and actually listens and hears what patient’s say. I can’t imagine trusting anyone like I trust her,Female

"Dr. Faber and his staff are the Best in Rhode Island. Period.
   I no longer struggle with my Asthma. It's amazing the difference.   
My kids no longer get ear infections every other week, from the tubes he put in their ears nor do they suffer like I had for so long with Asthma.   These were symptoms that other ENT doctors/pediatricians couldn't figure out.  He literally saved my fathers life on a golf course with instruments he kept on him.  
  I can not say enough good things about Dr.Faber ",Male
I have been a patient of Dr Faber for over 25 years. He is honest and very upfront and to the point. I was diagnosed with cancer. Together we decided to go to Dana Farber and treat my illness there through his office. Dr. handled all my needs here while getting communications back from Dana Farber. He was very compassionate to my sickness and helped me in all ways. I had just lost my mother and was diagnosed with a cancer at the same time. Dr was very truthful. His office is great! and HE!,Male

"spent 30 minutes with me and my child.  only doctor who could examine my child and made him feel incredibly comfortable.  secretary stated he ""was getting behind"" but he was only concerned about my child.  Was able to remove a bead from his ear while all the other docs wanted him to be brought to surgery under anesthesia.  Secretaries are great also.  Definitely recommend.",Male
"Waited 40 minutes to be seen. Front desk staff and nurses are wonderful. Dr. Fabre not so much. Only seen for 5 minutes the 2 times I went. After getting a MRI done went back and he came in and the 1st thing he said to me was ""Oh goodness. This is bad. Very bad."" Has a horrible bedside manner. Also upon check out decided to criticize, or talk down to, one of the front desk staff right in front of me which I thought was unprofessional.",Male
incredibly knowledgable!   Only physicians who thought outside the box to make my diagnosis.  Staff was extremely friendly .,Male
"Nice bedside manner..he didn't do any testing when I viaduct 3 yrs ago...have me antibiotic and tools me if I came back Id get a tonsilectomy. 

Thus year had issues again and got 2nd opinion..CT scan done and found deviated septum from age of 2 yrs caused significant blockages....requiring surgery. On the road to recovery 3 yrs later than necessary.
I don't blame doctors when hesitant to do testing,  often they have large magnifying glass on them...but you still have to do right for the patient",Male
Wish I could give 0 stars. the staff is terrible. Waited an hour and a half both times I visited. Dr. Faber sent me for testing I did not need which ended up being very expensive. Dr. Faber has terrible bedside manner. Would NOT recommend to my worst enemy.,Male
I paid the bill twice and am not able to receive my refund. I've been told on several occasions of my calling that they review MONTHLY and every overcharge is reimbursed...that was my first call to the office.  My second call I'm told they review the accts but sometimes not monthly but they will reimburse me and its been since Oct 20 since the original bill was paid then Oct 23 when the second was cashed and its January and still no refund.,Male

"Not only would I not recommend Dr. Faber, when friends and family ask me for my opinion I strongly warn them AGAINST Spinal Interventions.

"Dr. Faber is an amazing doctor.  He has helped my children better manage their anxiety and cope with daily stressors.  He is patient, kind, calm and very easy to talk to.  I cannot say enough good things about him.  He relates very well to his patients, includes them in decision making and has a gentle way about him.  The differences we have seen in the childrens' mental health are remarkable since working with Dr. Faber.",Male

beyond what is expected of a psychiatric professional. I don't know what I would do without
him.",Male

"Dr. Faber has helped both of of my sons. He takes the time to get to know the patient and their health history.  He doesn’t just put a bandaid on whatever the issue may be, but instead digs deep to get to the root cause of the issue, and comes up with a plan to fix the issue. We like that he focuses on healing the body through different avenues. He has great interactions with both my boys and is truly making positive changes in their health! ",Male

Dr. Faber is but one man; but a man who takes excellent care of hundreds of grumpy patients, and gives them the best care available to him. We are SO fortunate to have this good doctor to help me through a very ugly illness. I've always trusted him with my life and shall continue to do so. Dr. Faber seems to actually CARE about his many patients. He is just a truly great physician who does no harm. Thank you Doctor and thank you to your staff also. You're a good friend.

"Dr. Faber and staff at Elizabeth City, NC were awesome, friendly and professional. Waiting time was a bit long, but once you see the doctor it is clear why. They took their time to answer all questions or doubts that I had and really made me feel welcomed since the moment I entered the building. Would recommend.",Male
"I've been one of Dr. Fabers' patients since 1997. Dr. Faber is an excellent, considerate, and caring gastroenterologist who has afforded me a much better quality of life than I had before I was diagnosed. I have been receiving infusions from the local hospital for over 15 years with only wonderful results. After all these years, my primary insurance suddenly denied the payment to the hospital. With Dr. Fabers' help, and his staff, Sherry in particular, insurance agreed to pay. GREAT doc/staff",Male
One of the most caring brilliant Doctors we have ever been to. He literally saved my life! We would highly recommend him to anyone that needs his expertise! His staff are all friendly and highly efficient! You will know you are in the best of hands with Dr. Faber.,Male
Dr Faber fixed my bulging discs without surgery .  In only 5 visits he removed 90% of my lower back painand with a few more I was pain free for the first time in many years.,Male
I liked his approach to my recent medical condition.,Male
He did wrong side surgery on my dad for subdural hematoma. My dad never recovered.,Male
"This was my second procedure with Dr Fabi.  9 years ago he put in a Dorsal Column Stimulator and most recently the system was removed.

"Dr. Fabi was very caring, component, and professional.  Dr. Fabi was highly effective getting me back on my feet and feeling so much better!",Male
dishonest and incompetent,Male
He is the Greatest Surgeon Ever . AND yes his bed side manners are awesome . I had rods put in the lower part of my back where I had a blown disc and had infusion 3and 4 both side I'm doing great but I did have 2 surgeries in same spot second time extension on both the the rods and I fusion on both side both he said my spine is weak all the way up . And one really good holding me together but he truly did a fantastic job on my back and I just today referred 1 of my high school friends up their .,Male
My procedure did not go as planned. Continued to have residual nerve pain 10 months later and I followed Dr and PT's instruction to the letter. Was told that was normal. Had another MRI done because this didn't seem normal to me and it turns out that I have problems with the same disc. So now back to square one and will most likely have to go through the whole surgical process again to hopefully resolve the issue.,Male
I have nothing but high praise for Dr Fabi and his work.  I don't know why ANYONE would rate him any less than 5 stars.   He treated me for a bulging disc over 4 years ago now and that operation has literally changed my life - for the better.  At that time I had been experiencing back pain for over 30 years using other approaches short of surgery.  His work combined with a hip replacement - also done  at Bronson have left me free of low back pain ever since.,Male
"It was a diagnosis that took me by surprise, and a surgery scheduled quickly. Dr. Fabi made me feel very comfortable and confident in the surgery and in him to preform it. I highly recommend Dr. Fabi and his staff. Due to my experience with Dr. Fabi, his staff, Bronson Hospitals professionalism and their follow up, I have decided to look for a Bronson MD, after many many years with another hospital. ",Male
"Hands down couldn't have asked for a better brain surgeon! 2 years post-op and the MRI scans can barely even tell there was a tumor in there! Absolutely excellent job and I would recommend him to anyone needing this serious level of medical attention. (Not to mention as a 24 year old female, he did a great job in shaving the smallest amount of hair off and considered how it would all be affected.) Best experience possible for what was going on!",Male
"Dr. Fabi, has done several difficult back surgeries on me that have all been very successful. He even referred me to The Cleveland Clinic and they said his care and treatment for me was excellent and that they could do nothing better then he had done. They were astonished with his design and placement of rods and said they had never seen such detailed work.  Needless to say I hold him in highest esteem, and do highly recommend him
                                               
",Male
I had two very difficult back procedures performed by Dr. Fabi and I was exceptionally pleased with the level of skill and expertise he exhibited.   ,Male
Was very satisfied with Dr. Fabi's thoughts on my problem relating to my knee.......look forward to resolving problem as effectively and promptly as possible.......,Male
"Dr. Fabi has an outstanding way of communicating with his patients.

He has made me feel he really cares for me personally.
He is very professional but also very caring.
His staff also displays the same level of concern and care.

Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses I had special concerns with bloodless surgery.
He was very respectful to my beliefs and assured me he would follow my requests which was a refreshing experience.

His patients and willingness to answer my many questions put me at ease throughout my hip revision.

"Tomorrow marks week 12 since my total knee replacement by Dr. Fabi and I feel wonderful!  I am so grateful to live in San Diego and have the opportunity to be a patient of this amazing and truly skilled surgeon. From my first office visit, it was clear that I was in the hands of a caring and very talented doctor who is clearly at the top of his game. I went into surgery without an ounce of fear and a feeling of excitement knowing that if I did my part with physical therapy my life would be changed forever. And it is! Thank you for this wonderful gift, Dr. David Fabi.",Male
Knowledgeable and Caring Doctor.,Male
"Dr. Fabi delivered beyond what we could have imagined.  Considering I have a brain injured brother who broke his right foot in May then had a right knee replacement 6 months later.   

Both surgeries tended by Dr. Fabi. 
Dr. Fabi's diligent and impeccable care-- Marc was able to overcome many obstacles with the doctors advice.

Imagine the difficulty of a head injury of severe short term memory loss-- reminding NOT to bear weight for 6 weeks after the foot surgery in order to have a successful outcome was critical. 
Not to mention Marc already has a left side with its own impairments from a motorcycle accident years ago.
To think Dr. Fabi mended both right foot and knee (surgery 6 months apart) and the outcome a success is a true miracle.
The staff was kind and the doctors positive, compassionate care made all the difference in healing a broken spirit that has so much already to deal with a severe brain injury.
Thank you Dr. Fabi for your steady hand and heartfelt care.",Male
"I was seen on Wednesday 1/6/21 &amp; was in &amp; out, in about 35min. Great Staff &amp; very Friendly. &amp; Dr. Fabi is awesome. Really listens to your concerns",Male
"After after several years of discomfort in my right hip,  and trying to work through it with physical therapy I sought out Dr. David Fabi for help. By then my entire leg hurt and I could hardly walk. He performed an anterior total hip replacement. I was walking the same day and went home the next morning. Within a few days I was off pain meds, walking in the neighborhood and doing helpful exercises with my physical therapist. I started driving at one week and by the third week was able to get back to a daily 3 mile walk/slow jog. I love my hip replacement and highly recommend Dr. Fabi. He is skilled as well as being a warm, friendly human being!",Male
Exceptionally intelligent and understanding. I recommend him to anyone dealing with knee issues.,Male
Dr.Fabi cares about patients and he apreciates well being&gt;Ithank him,Male
I had anterior right total hip replacement. Hospital at 5:30 am surgery and home the same day by 5:00 pm.,Male
"Dr Fabi is an Excellent Surgeon. Very concerned with my comfort and well being. Efficient, knowledgeable staff. My recovery for each knee went exceptionally well. I would recommend Dr Fabi without hesitation.",Male
"Two weeks after outpatient total anterior hip replacement I'm cleared to ride my bike.  It was reassuring to not spend time in hospital and the day after surgery I was able to get around the house. Within 4 days I was carefully walking a block without a cane or walker. Drove after 1 week. 

I was taken aback by the leg swelling and bruising that extended below my knee between days 4 and 8 but it cleared up with doctor reassurance,  frequent ice, elevation, short walks and arnica gel. Also had not expected the concurrent muscle pain and spasm in my thigh - this hurt more than the surgery area. Undeterred, I kept moving and all was gone by day 12.

Having no movement restrictions is so helpful for rapid recovery. No PT ordered nor needed. Wow, its so much better than I expected. Have no fear, Dr. Fabi is the bomb!",Male
"I was diagnosed with a severe osteoarthritis of my hips which was causing a constant pain, stiffness and restricted movements not only in my hips, but in my lower back and even my knees. I felt I was falling apart. 
Dr. Fabi performed a total hip replacement surgery of both, my left and right hips,  3.5 months apart. He did an excellent job and met my expectations completely. I was able to walk the same day of the surgery and after the second week I was able to walk without a cane, and was able to drive my car. I was very happy with the members of his team Nithya, Monica and Letty , as well! Everybody performed their jobs with professionalism, accuracy and care. The physiotherapy sessions following the surgeries are helping me to restore  the length, mobility and strength of my muscled. My hips, lower back and knee pain are gone. All what has left are my incisions which are gradually fading away with every single day.",Male
Dr.Fabi was able to preform above and beyond expectations. He replaced my hip after having to jump through all the hurdles put in place during the pandemic. Thanks Dr.Fabi.,Male
"I received a hip replacement in 2020.   I could not be happier with the result.     Prior to surgery I was having pain in multiple places around my hip.  Even lifting groceries caused pain.  I had to give up sports.   I tried getting shots in my hip but that did not relieve the pain.  My personal physician had recommended Dr Fabi as he too had his hip replaced by Dr Fabi.   Dr Fabi took xrays and showed me the deterioration in one of my hips and thus my source of pain.   My hip replacement by Dr. David Fabi was smoother and less complicated than I had ever imagined.   I know no 2 patients are alike, but with the prescribed medications my pain level, on a scale of 1 to 10, never was above a 1.   I faithfully did the physical therapy exercises and I have had zero complications.  I wish I could have had this procedure by Dr Fabi years ago.   My other hip has not yet been a problem, but if one day it does become  problem, I would actually look forward to surgery again with Dr Fabi.",Male
"I had a traumatic knee injury, but was treated as if the problem was arthritis. I had 2 arthroscopic surgeries to the same knee as the first had complications, with very poor follow-up care. After the second I had new meniscus tears and a cyst, with additional problems. I had requested knee replacement, as recommended by other doctors, but was strongly advised against it or any other procedure. Trusting, I agreed to the surgeries and as a result I have been in worse pain. Two years have past and 3 orthopedics have asked me why I didn't get a knee replacement, as they looked puzzled at my MRI. That is my story. I had a traumatic injury, but being in my 50' s it was of no concern. Arthritis with age related wear and tear are too often applied to guarantee oneself ""immunity"".
Protect yourself, as in the end it is your quality of life and it will make it much harder to find help later.",Male
"I'm just into the 8th week after total anterior right hip replacement by Dr. Fabi, enjoying nearly full range of motion, no pain and got the ok to get back into the pool!  I am over the moon with the results from this operation by Dr. Fabi and his staff.  Highly recommend this compassionate and talented surgeon.  He will change your life!",Male
"Dr. Fabi is a highly technically skilled orthopedic surgeon. He possesses a personable bedside manner and compassionate communication style. Two weeks ago, he performed my total hip replacement. The successful result gave me back my active lifestyle.",Male
"Doctor Fabi replace both my knees on the 16, I was walking without a walker or cain on day 3 (19th). On 2 week visit to office folks in the waiting room and at the elevator noticed my bandages on both knees, found it hard to believe I had both knees replaced at same time and were impressed at how well I moved about/walked- it felt good

Patient.  Dave Semling",Female
"Dr. Fabi is quite incredible.  She came to the appointment fully versed about me from my records.  I had been a patient in the group for about 13 years but my doc retired.  Dr. Fabi is super smart, intuitive, patient, easy to talk to and gave me a fine exam and advice.   I consider myself so very fortunate to now be able to call her my doctor!  I walked in nervous and left the office fully confident and relaxed.  Her nurse is also great and gave me a pretty painless tetanus shot!  Front office staff was cordial and efficient.  Highly recommend!",Female
"I had the most awful experience with Dr. Fabi. I saw her in the After Hours clinic for a white lump inside my throat. She looked at it and said ""It looks like Cancer. Do you smoke?"" I was stunned, having recovered from thyroid cancer 2 years prior. I told her I quit smoking 35 years ago and all she said is I should see an ENT. When my ENT examined me 10 agonizing days later, she right away said this does not look anything like cancer, it looks like a cyst. Furthermore, she said no doctor should ever blurt out the C word until a thorough evaluation is conducted. I was sent off for all the tests and sure enough it came back as a simple cyst. Dr Fabi refused to waive her fee, billed and received hundreds of dollars from my insurance, and even was going to send my account into collections if I didn't pay the $20 copay. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",Female
"The worse experience I have ever had.  She doesn't listen, she treated me disrespectfully, was rude and made assumptions with finding out the facts.  Stay away from her!!!!",Female
"Went for a physical and she didn't even touch me, all talk
Then I got a bill for something she didn't even do and they charged $90 up front for a tetanus shot that my insurance covers but they insisted they would reimburse and never did.",Female
"My elder parents moved to Marin and needed a new primary care physician.  I have taken them both to see Dr Fabi, and we are all so relieved to have found her.  My Dad is a retired physician himself and has given her two thumbs up and is so impressed with her approach and care.  I have sat in on three appointments, and feel very grateful to have found a great doctor to be there for my folks. Good bedside manner, very smart and sensible, listens well, explains options and considerations clearly.  ",Female
"Love her!  Dr. Fabi is the consummate professional and very knowledgeable.  She took the time to talk with me about my concerns, I never felt rushed, and she provided some valuable insight on my situation.  I've been seeking a primary physician, and haven't been happy with my choices until I met with Dr. Fabi.

I had recommended her to my Sister who just recently went for her annual physical, and her sentiments were the same as mine.   I would 100% recommend Dr. Fabi.",Female
"After losing my physician of 30 years, I luckily found Dr. Fabi!

Great bedside manner. Treats I with respect and dignity,Female
"Excellent doctor have been seeing her since 2002 , excellent service, very professional and personable",Female
"I went in for a basic wellness checkup. We discussed a couple small concerns, which she ordered unnecessary and expensive testing and CAT scans (verified by a second opinion). She ordered these exams based on verbal description alone, not basic examination as was done by the second opinion doctor. My visit was coded incorrectly and her office billed me more than reasonable. I spoke with Dr. Fabi, who agreed a mistake was made and the coding would be changed. Instead, it was sent to collections.",Female
"Dr. Fabi was my doctor quite some time ago.  Her bedside manners were great, but overall, she was honestly just mediocre.  ",Female
"Dr. Fabi is an excellent primary care physician. She listens well to whatever I have to say. She will recommend Specialty Physicians when necessary and they are top physicians. She is available by phone as well as by phone. Whatever medical issuses I have had, she has known exactly what and who will work for me. I highly recommend Dr. Fabi.",Female
Well when I moved to this area she was my first primary doctor. And she was the best I was nervous to open up about my ADD and anxiety disorder but she listened and was just so awesome and she started me on a regiment of meds that has made me a new person.

"Wish I could give MORE stars!  I was referred to Dr. Fabi from my dermatologist, Stacy Tompkins, MD.  When I first met Sabrina on the office visit I felt like I had known her my entire life.  She's kind, funny, engaging, unpretentious and caring.  I've always felt and acted young for my ""age"", but now I look younger too.  Dr. Fabi is very impressive.  She spends a lot of time teaching about her field to other parts of the world, so I know she's respected.  Her staff is an extension of herself.  They ALL treat you like family and genuinely care about your health.  Also, kudos to her office manager, Marie.  She is amazing too.

During the procedures, I felt very little to no pain, and the results were very natural-looking — just a younger, fresh-faced version of myself.

"I have been seeing Dr. Fabian for a few years. I have been disappointed on multiple occasions - but mostly every year during my physical when she pushes the flu shot. She makes me feel like I am killing innocent people if I refuse to take it. When I say no, she ask me about 4 more times and then is grumpy when she leaves. Does she get paid per flu shot?",Female
"Here is my experience, I developed inflammation in all my joints. I saw her as she was my primary care physician. She told me it was a virus and sent me home. I came back after five days as it was getting worse. She decided to run labs and found that I had soring inflammation. She said “ well, your labs show inflammation so it’s not all in your head”. What? I never thought it was “in my head”. I suffered for weeks before I was finally granted a referral to an RA doctor and was diagnosed with RA.",Female
"Dr. Fabian takes the time to listen to my concerns and problems, and each time has found a solution that is more than satisfactory.  The nurses are excellent as well.",Female
"Dr Fabain always listens to my concerns. She addresses my concerns and tells me what her recommendations are. She respects my opinion and together we make decisions about my health care. She is not judgmental, as many doctors have attendency to be with type  one diabetes patients, unless they have the disease themselves. She is caring and takes time with me. I am able to get appointments when I need them. She does not hesitate to send referrals when needed or requested. Highly recommend!",Female
Dr. Fabian seemed very judgmental and self righteous when me and my daughter were under her care. She was unwilling to look at holistic remedies for my condition. ,Female
She doesn't truly listen and always seem in a rush to get out of the room.  Her nurses are awesome.  She tends to offer you pain meds or a referral without addressing the problem at hand.  She doesn't always do a thorough examination.,Female
"Tried using her with our new born son and sadly stayed for one year. Just found a new doc (ped) who is awesome. Son was sick for half a year. I had to finally ask her for a referral to a specialist which she ho-hummed about... specialist got the priblem cleared up in 2 days. Rediculous. My son was in pain for months under her care, when she should have persued other options if she was stumped. 

We also had her as our adult family doc. Did not appreciate her bedside manner, though some do.",Female
The office took my insurance information and told me they accepted my insurance. Then when I got there I had to  pay $200.00 instead of $35.00 which is my co pay because they play the insurance game. They accept it but Not in my network. A big Florida doctor game. That’s a bad practice that is money grabbing that does this.,Male
Dr. Fabian and his staff are outstanding! I travel from Marco Island and it was so worth it. He explained the entire procedure and  was so kind and caring. His PA was wonderful and the the gals that assisted were so professional. Loved his office staff also.,Male
Staff was very friendly and helpful with everything during my visit.  Everything was explained prior to procedure as well while they are doing it things were reassured and put me at ease. Nurses are wonderful at giving numbing never felt a thing.,Male
"If you make an appointment, do not let the front desk schedule you with the nurse practitioner at the bonita office. Must have barely any experience but diagnoses, and incorrectly at that, without even doing the full examination.",Male
This man blew me off.  Misdiagnosed my issue because he spent little time examining me.  Then prescribed a $400 shampoo and when I was shocked at the price asked how much I made and then said you can afford it. When he left the nurse confided she had no health insurance because she could not afford it.  I know dermatologists in this area make up to and ove a million dollars a year. He can't offer subsidy to his experienced staff?!!!!,Male
He blew me off. Commented that I could afford the $400 shampoo recommended. Than found out his own nurse has no health insurance!  I know what dermatologist make and that is unconscionable. I had serious issue and he said psoriasis without a full inspection.  Never recommend a visit here,Male
He's Rude. He's brusque and he doesn't explain anything.  His staff is rude and he offered a procedure on my face which left a small scar without advising me it would scar.  Would not let my dog go there.,Male
"When I told Dr. Fabian's colleague I felt amorous on Prozac, she said ""What does that word mean?!"" I said ""you know, like in love. Like I wanna kiss you."" When he came back on Monday he yelled ""For what you did, I'm sending you to Greystone."" Greystone sent me home.",Male
May God have mercy on Dr. F's soul...,Male
Excellent doctor who knows his stuff. Kind hearted too.,Male
"I somehow injured my back and over time, it gradually was getting worse.  I was having increased pain and sciatica which in turn, made it so I was out on disability from my job.  We had tried all the go to procedures and therapies but was all the better I was going to get and was still unable to go back to work.   My insurance was giving me the runaround and not approving my surgery.  Dr Fabian and his staff helped me to get my surgery approved and after over a year, I was finally able to have my L5/S1 fused.  It was like night and day, even during the first week post op.  My job is very demanding and even after almost 5 years, I still am a success story and huge fan of Dr Fabian and his knowledge that gave me my life back.",Male
I went through 2 surgeons for my back and was basically butchered and crippled by severe pain and my entire right leg was number. I had given up on any surgeon and resigned myself to a life of falls and looking at my horse not riding again. I was at my general MD and he recommended Dr. Fabian and I am so grateful. Please go see this amazing surgeon!! You won't regret it!,Male

"I have been treating with Dr. Fabian since approximately 1992.  She was my internist.  I had to find another doctor when she decided to specialize in diabetes.  Of course I assumed I would never get that.  Well I am treating with her now.  She is wonderful, takes time with her patients.  And I owe her the world for finding my mom's breast cancer during an exam.  I was able to have my mom for 28 more years.  I would recommend her in a heart beat.",Female
I found Dr. Fabian a total waste of time. Beyond her scale she was neither helpful nor knowledgeable about weigh loss beyond a few medical suggestions. And what was the worst came when I requested my records to see another specialist and found rude and slanderous remarks she made about me and our visit. When my new doctor reviewed her comments and compared it to my new and follow up labs she seemed confused and kept asking questions about the treatment plan I received from her.,Female
She was amazing. She made me feel so comfortable and at ease. I just love her.,Female

"I have had 32 to visits to ER between Aug and October I have called her office several times telling them I'm bleeding large black clots when it's not my period.

"""I don’t even know where to begin. I woke from a routine total thyroidectomy July 2010. I was told I might have a bit of hoarseness and sore. I never expected my life would be changed forever. Dr Fabian was a pleasant and knowledgeable Dr. I met him once to discuss the “simple “ procedure. Afterwards I spent days and weeks in agony. Not unexpected. But three months following the surgery I still had no voice at all. Nothing but a whisper. A career professor and educator , I looked forward to ridding the inflamed gland and moving forward with my life and career. I called Dr Fabian’s office to ask him to see me that I was concerned about my loss of voice. My inability to swallow and extreme pain. I was told that only if my endocrinologist felt I needed to be seen that I would be brought in. My referring endocrinologist said I did not need to see him.  It wasn’t till my primary referred me to ENTs and it was confirmed. I was robbed of early intervention and face a life sentence of pain.",Male
Dr. Fabian performed a surgical biopsy on my breast.  He explained everything well and demonstrated a very caring attitude.  He was highly recommended by other local medical professionals.  Very happy with him.,Male
Went to the ER for abdominal pain. The ER doc thought it was diverticulitis. Dr Fabian showed up after reviewing the CT scan and knew immediately it was a ruptured appendix. Scheduled and performed removal the next day. Super bedside manner fabulous surgeon. Professional service. Highly recommended. ,Male
"The lack of professionalism with Dr. Fabian and Chrisanne has become laughable at this point. Let's just say, I realized there was no way I could trust my body in their hands and cancelled the surgery in the prep room after speaking with Dr. Fabian. A week or so later, I received a phone call asking why I missed my appointment, indicating that there is a serious lack in communication. A week after that, I received a letter that can only be described as a ""No, I broke up with you"" letter. ",Male

Dr. Fabian is a good communicator, compassionate, and skilled in getting desired results. The experience was excellent in all respects.",Male
"Dr Fabian saved my life when I had sepsis and peritonitis. He is professional, extremely competent, and I was very lucky that he was on call when I was admitted through the ER.

I have a colostomy revision surgery scheduled with him in March and would not think of going to anyone else. I highly recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Fabian is one of the most trusted physicians I have been a patient of. He was very thorough in explaining the procedure for an inguinal hernia repair and once again, explained everything I needed to know on surgery day.

"Bill Fabian was my cardiologist.  When I met Dr. Fabian, I had already been examined by doctors in two other states, including heart doctors at the #1 cardiac hospital in America.  However, I was still having issues.  Bill paid special attention to my case, and took the testing to a new level, where it was discovered that I needed heart surgery (after Bill had collaborated with the surgery team concerning my test results).  Eleven months after surgery, I can honestly say that Bill &amp; team saved my life.  I can hike big hills out-here in Colorado without getting heart palpitations.  I can carry my groceries up the stairs without getting winded.  My life is my life again, and without the restrictions and constraints I had encountered prior to being in Bill's care.  I cannot emphasize enough how thankful I am that I found Dr. Fabian, that he took such an interest in my case, and that I am living a far better life today, than I was just a year ago.",Male

Dr Fabiano is one of the most caring dr’s I have had the privilege of knowing. I had a very serious spinal decompression which left alone would have caused paralysis. He immediately recognized the seriousness of my problem and had me into surgery within 5 days from initial consult. I can’t thank him enough for his caring demeanor along with his entire staff. I am recovering and learning to walk again and it’s a slow but steady progress but I will be ok thanks to him !!,Male
"Had a total knee replacement, couldn't be happier.",Male
"Loved him ....to the point,but I felt very comfortable with the diagnosis and his explaination",Male
"Dr. Fabiano rushed me out of my first visit. I had an X-ray from my family doctor of my knee, he said, it's bone on bone knee, no surgery today, just a cortizone shot. He rushed out  like he was at a race track. Dr Fabino was with me less than 5 minutes. I felt that he didn't care about me. I pay good money for my health insurance and co payment and I expect excellent service.
 I didn't get to ask why I have so pain in my knee and thigh. The physical therapist that my family doctor sent me to thought it was a torn meniscus. I'm going to different orthopedic surgeon.  Dr Fabiano has no bed side manners, he didn't adress me by my name or took any time to talk to me or explain things or if I had any questions. A friend referred me to Fabino. My friend said, he is a great doctor. I beg to differ.I wish I could find out what is causing this pain. First impressions count on the first doctor's visit and Dr Fabino failed.I would give him 0 stars if I could.",Male
Horrible “doctor” did surgery on my foot and messed it up so I had to see another “doctor” who also messed it up. Went in another time with my bad knee and I said I didn’t want the cortisone shot he didn’t listen to me and just jabbed the needle in and then walked out. He has done surgery on 3 other people I know and has messed them up too. PCI really needs to make sure their doctors know what they are doing.,Male
"he may not have the best bed side manner. However he does know what he is doing.  Ask questions and be apart of ur health experience. no one can read your mind  so if you have a question or a concern, address it at the time you are there'",Male
"He did my first rotatory cuff repair did a great job now seeing him for the other shoulder after a fall. Only seen him once so for, need to get MRI before we decide what comes next.  Very happy with him so far, will update after MRI. ",Male
"When my loved one was in the hospital and having medical issues, nurses couldn’t get ahold of him. He will not return calls to physical therapy or the hospital on his patients care, even when it’s emergent",Male

"worst doctor ever, flung door open and hit daughter and didn't even apologize. i warned a co worker who was taking his son, guess he didn't take me serious and the same thing happened",Male
"Two months ago, Dr. Fabiano said my options were to have surgery to repair my torn rotator cuff or  get a cortisone shot to get by until after back surgery. I took the shot. This time, he said he'd give me another shot, but there was nothing wrong other than slight fraying and to go to PT and then rushed me out of his office.  I came home all confused. Turns out he had looked at an old MRI from a few years ago instead of the one from a few moths ago. Rude, condescending and unprofessional.",Male
"Twice saw for shoulder injury - first rotator cuff, second broken humerus after a fall. Trust him completely. Does what is needed, doesn't push unnecessary procedures. Sometimes quiet, but great sense of humor. Independent PT told me his patients healed faster and better than anybody else's. ",Male
"Very personable, knowledgeable and explains things in an understandable way.  I trust him completely!!!",Male
"Dr. Fabiano was very concise in his diagnosis and straight forward with what it would take to repair my knee injury.

"I was under the care of Dr. Fabiano during her partnership with Mercy Health systems, she always took the time and explained to me what my options were.

"Dr. Fabiano was the only
Physician who actually sat down and listened to me.  She had compassion for my situaution and helped me in more ways than simply writing prescriptions.  She is a true lifesaver and a great physician.  ",Female
"If this is the Doctor Tina Fabiano who accepted me as a patient with Mercy Healthcare in 2015, then dropped me (knowing she was going to be leaving the system), then I warn you to look for another doctor. Not only because of that, but also because she was cold, never had my medications updated in the system after our visits, rushed me out of her office on each visit in addition to poor if any communication at all between departments (such as for my surgery which was postponed due to incompetence",Female
Very nice bedside manor!  Explained my new diagnosis to me and answered all the questions I had.  She put my mind at ease and made me feel like I was her only patient.  ,Female
This doctor has the rudest staff I have ever encountered. When I returned their call the girl was chewing and talking with a mouthful of food. One nurse scolded me for not talking to her prior to my phone consult!  Both times I visited with the doctor (once in person and once by phone) he was interrupted or called away for some other reason (not an emergency). Would not recommend this practice.,Male

She said ""I check your results &amp; come back"", 3 hours went by, she NEVER returned. I demanded that the nurses contact her, low &amp; behold she left the hospital.

Dr Ha is the attending physician of a family member who is in the hospitol. He has terrible bedside manners.  He doesn't have enough practical experience in my opinion to treat complicated cases or disease management for older patients. He is young and inexperienced. I say that from my interactions with him. He doesn't follow through after places medical orders to complete what he promises. He also will not return your phone calls if you leave a message. I only learned later he is out of med school/internship only four years. If he continues this way he is going to be a terrible Dr.,Male
"This doctor is arrogant, immature and needs to learn how to talk to people without losing his bearings and tone down his god complex.",Male
We love DR. HA.  She is friendly and genuine.  She really cares for her patients.  We feel comfortable and the kids just love her.  She's amazing!,Female
"Office turned our child away after we let them know that the child had a runny nose with no fever last week.  All the reviews of Dr. Ha being caring, sweet, and understanding seem to be all good as long as your kid isn't sick.  Imagine a doctor who refuses to see patients when they are ill?",Female
She is nothing less than amazing. I was introduced to her as she was the pediatric doctor that came from Beach Pediatric which I had s different doctor for my daughter. . but I was so impressed by Dr. Ha bedside manner that I switched my daughter to Dr. Ha as her pediatrician.

Dr Ha is so caring and taking time time with your baby,Female
I met him at CT office last year and I continue to see at his MP office.   I saw him because I was on hormone pills to regulate my periods flow for a couple of years and tried to seek his opinion to see if I can stop taking those pills. He advised not to be on the pills for too long in order to avoid other medical issues. He is very patient and he will answer all my issues and concerns. I would definitely recommend him to my friends and relatives.,Male
Listens and takes me serious. Seems to genuinely care,Male
"Dr. Ha's diagnosis, that my back is a mess, was not helpful. His treatment plan was that, when I am in so much pain that I can't stand it, then I might consider surgery. He offered no advice about non-surgical approaches to pain management.",Male
"Great, no-nonsense spine surgeon. He fixed a herniated disc in my spine and relieved the horrible pain I had had for three months.",Male
"Very direct and precise. I feel Dr Ha was the most informed Orthopedic Surgeon that I dealt with for my injury. Even though my injury is very severe, Dr Ha was able to relate my options in a way I felt comfortable with. ",Male
"Dr Ha has always been great with me. She takes the time to listen to me about my issues and has been very helpful with my treatments. She is easy to get ahold of and responds to questions / concerns right away.

I would certainly recommend her to others.",Female
"Dr Ha has always been pleasant and courteous.  She exhibits concern for her patients and is right on target with her diagnoses, too.  Dr. Ha actually spends time with her patients and is quick to get back with you.
Her staff workers have always been polite and pleasant.  As to the person who made those negative comments about Dr. Ha and her staff, I can only conclude that he either went to a different Dr. Ha. or has a vendetta  My experience has been quite positive.",Female
"Rude, doesn't seem experienced enough to know basic medical practice. Don't waste your time. ",Female
"Dr Ha had one heck of a job ahead of him when he took on my nose...couldnt breath 9+ broken noses and shattered a few times from sports and boxxing... he got it straight which it hasn't been in 25 years and I can breath even with all the swelling 3 days later....
If nothing else I trust this man's word and recomendation. Will it move as much air as I hope I dont k ow st this point it was pretty smashed up does it work better even while swollen than before surgery...yes.

No shortcuts just A+",Male
"He was very rough and insensitive.  Not a skillful, and experienced doctor to put your beauty in his hands.",Male
"Have had 3 GI’s in 3 different cities since my crohn’s diagnosis. Dr. Ha has been, far and away, the worst doctor on several levels. For one: she has zero empathy or compassion. When you’re frustrated, her messaging is always “be patient” or “stick to the plan” despite it blatantly not working. Secondly, she passes the buck. After detailing my day to day symptoms during month # 6 of a flare, her only response was recommending me getting a 2nd opinion. Not offering to tell me what to do that day (start or stop medication or treatment), but just coldly telling me to get a 2nd opinion. Don’t let the good reviews fool you - she hates men. She’s unprofessional. She’ll let you wither away because she doesn’t care about you. She pushes towards surgery when most doctors only view it as last resort. I would never recommend her.

"I was a resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital when Dr Ha diagnosed me with ulcerative colitis. She was kind, attentive, and conservative in her treatment and I am so thankful that she was the first to tell me about my disease. I am still trying to find as good of a doctor as her since she moved. Thank you Dr Ha",Female
Dr. Ha is an amazing Gastroenterologist. Every time I leave her office I am extremely happy with the significant amount of time she dedicates to understanding the status of my condition and answering all the questions I have about next steps regarding medications or procedures. She is also very quick to respond to any questions I send to her through email when I am not able to visit her office. She is truly the best GI doctor I have ever had.,Female
"Dr. Ha is an unusually competent physician who also has a kind, concerned bed side manner.   She took a thorough medical history and made a clear plan for care.  I was overwhelmingly impressed with her and her entire staff.  This is world class medicine at it's best.",Female
I absolutely love Dr. Ha. She became our sons' pediatrician after I delivered my 3rd son at St. Anthony. We didn't know any other pediatricians at that time and I felt very comfortable when she came into the hospital room. She is a very warm person and she is open to any other alternatives than just a prescription. I definitely recommend her for all my kids' needs.,Female
She makes both my son and myself very comfortable with any concerns we have.,Female
"Dr. Ha is great with our 3-year-old son. We moved to the area and found her based off her other glowing reviews - and we haven't been disappointed yet. The office (front desk) staff at the Broadway location could smile a bit more but Dr. Ha and her nurses are stellar. We feel very lucky to have her looking after our son and have never had an issue getting a same-day appointment for sick visits. Highly, highly recommend her care! Wait times aren't long either (a big one for me and any mom)!",Female
"Dr Ha has been my dermatologist for six years, and my experience with him has been outstanding in every way.",Male
"Self-righteous and rude cliquey office staff who cannot handle any constructive criticism or reality checks due to their inability to value the customer or even recognize you as a fellow human being. They do not answer their phones and return messages and when confronted deny that they even have any answering service abilities whatsoever and will argue, argue, argue that point to no end. Unprofessional, unhelpful, lazy, snooty, out of control office staff who need Dr. Ha to reign them back in. I",Male
"An ideal doctor that all patients expect is a doctor that is skilled and caring. This is Dr. Ha, a phenomenal medical doctor with professional medical skills and knowledge as well as sincerity and caring.  As a cancer survivor along with a few chronicle diseases, I have been able to still stay positive towards my health issues because of the medical care, the motivation, the personal caring to patients, and the education that Dr. Ha has given.  In addition, the staff in Dr. Ha's office is super friendly, patient, and helpful. I honestly consider myself very blessed to have Dr. Ha to be my doctor. I really wish anyone who needs a doctor and is reading my review would give it try to visit Dr. Ha's clinic. You will appreciate it.",Male
"Very personable and explains things fully. As his first time patient though, I wished he would have done a more thorough physical on me though besides just a blood test. But he is patient and answers questions.",Male

"I would recommend Dr. Ha to literally anyone who needed a GYN or an OB, i have used her for both. Her bedside manner and ease of communication have really set a high bar for all of my future physicians, since i have left state. I wish i could take Dr. Ha and her team with me everywhere.",Female
"I love Dr. Ha! She has been my doctor for a few years, helped me navigate some health and hormonal issues, and has been my doctor thru this whole pregnancy. She is thorough, caring and kind. I have recommended her to others. ",Female
"Dr. Ha is patient, always answers my questions and called me several times to check in on me after an emotionally difficult experience. She is wonderful to work with.",Female
"She genuinely cares about symptoms I've been feeling. I like how she is a sole provider and an actual OBGYN doctor and not a midwife. She is very informative and tells you about optional tests available, but she is not pushy like other doctors. I also love how her goal is to have natural pregnancies, since most top-rated doctor reviews I've seen were all C-section deliveries.",Female
"It was very bad experience, she was not care about me at all and forced me to do unnecessary procedure which I was not ready to do it just because she wanted to make more money by my insurance. I never recommend her to anybody specially pregnant ladies.
 I never seen a doctor like her.

"Worst treatment ever. This doctor was on call for my doctor- when I said that I did not respect that she refused to call me back (it took 3 tries and 8 hours) she actually said I don't care if you respect me or not.

My son has been dealing with an undetermined skin issue for months and after several treatments that were not working, and with his discomfort increasing, Dr. Ha gave him a treatment plan that finally provided some relief.

"If I could give him no starts I would. I went for first time to have my mole check with Dr. Dong Ha in Alhambra. However, the lack of professionalism is unbelievable. He made me wait for over 40 minutes, then he walked in to the room without introducing himself. What kind of "" Doctor"" does that? so rude and lack of consideration toward his Patients. He did the examination for few seconds, without even asking me about my concerns. No treatment options was provided to me. It's too disappointing!!",Male
"Horrible Dr I wouldn't even call him a dr, his lack of intelligence on certain procedures is ridiculous, he kept stuttering and saying um!  I was in shock on how horrible this visit was, he displays procedures that he apparently does on his website but when I went in he said he hasn't done it on a long time, I would never recommend him to anyone.

"Dr. Ha is wonderful! My 5 year old daughter was dealing with chronic sinus infections/issues for over a year. We did our research and asked questions and saw 3 other ENTs before Dr. Ha and he's who we stuck with. He's very personable, listens, answers questions, shows concern, talks to you like a real person, all around great doctor. He's also totally willing to directly answer questions himself via email or phone which is just amazing. My daughter had her tonsils/adenoids removed by Dr. Ha and the surgery went extremely well. We're also addressing ongoing allergy issues with him and he is so open to exploring different options and is willing to admit that medicine has grey areas and you have to find what's best for THAT patient. Not just ""well here's the thing that will fix this and that's it"" and sends you on your way. Great doctor! Highly recommend.",Male
"Dr. Ha is a very caring, friendly and a fantastic doctor.   I suffered with breathing issues for years through my nasal passages. I saw other ENT's that could not help my condition.

He removed my tonsils for me at the age of 54 and based on what everyone had told me, I was pretty concerned about having it done at my age.

This may make it difficult to get an appointment through the operator but I called the office directly and got an appointment right away.  The waiting time is however still minimal compared to other doctor offices.  Dr Ha will take great care of you.  I have referred family members to him.

I also hope that my heart holds out long enough to see another day. Also please show me where Molly saw that I was on 50 blood pressure meds and an array of seizure meds. I had five seizures in one weekend and severe b/p high and low that landed me in icu. I’m on one B/P med and the two seizure meds prescribed on my discharge. I suggest you get your Molly in line and I suggest you see me since apparently your the one who saw me last. My health is declining and I deserve to see a doctor, not a mouthy uneducated molly pallin. I will not be treated that way. Nor, will she treat my son like she did and bring him to tears. Shame on Molly Pallin!",Male
Dr. Ha is an outstanding doctor.  His caring approach when dealing with his patients is so comforting and his willingness to take the time to listen to an individual's concerns is a rare find in today's hurry/in..hurry out medical practices.

We would absolutely recommend Dr. Ha to any one who needs someone to care for their heart related issues.  ,Male
"We needed a Cardiologist after hospitalist reported a F/U needed and Dr Ha was recommended. We waited a couple weeks but well worth the wait.

I have been going to YRMC Cardiology for many years for yearly check-up and occasionally in between.  Dr. Ha is the first doctor there that I can very much relate to.  I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a cardiologist.     ",Male
This doctor is a very simple man who explains every step of his examination. He explains his diagnosis and gives his opinion for you to understand. I was very impressed with him.,Male
very disappointed with the office staff. After 8 years of being a patient I was told by office staff that the dr is too busy to call me back.  Reception would not even take a message to give to the doctor. I understand we are in a Pandemic but the office is very unprofessional.,Female
"Dr Ha did a colon resection for me. It was a great experience from start to finish. She explains everything to you in a way you understand. She tells you the good, bad, and ugly that can happen but assured me it would all be ok. It can out wonderful and I am back to normal. ",Female

I had a diverticulitis flareup and called Dr. Ha’s office to have my meds refilled. I was told that since I had not been in for over a year I had to make an appointment and come in and be seen. There were no appointments available for four days. There is no way I could’ve waited that long. I was told I could then go to the ER or call my primary. Can you imagine telling someone to go to the ER in the mist of a pandemic?  Could they have been less sensitive? I cannot believe that was their rigid protocol. Needless to say I did not go to the ER and I got my medications elsewhere.,Female
I researched several doctors and decided to make an appointment with Dr. Ha. I’m so glad I did. She is knowledgeable and kind. I left her office feeling much better than when I arrived. ,Female

I would recommend anyone to see Dr. Ha if a surgeon is needed. Her expertise is the best of the best. ",Female
"Dr. Ha was so gracious to work me in from my ER visit and referral from the ER doctor.  She was very thorough, diagnosed my bizzare and extremely rare painful injury caused by a different doctor (whom I only saw once and he did a procedure incorrectly, leaving me with infection and damage).  Dr. Ha was a miracle from God and took immediate action with understanding, authority, a plan, serious antibiotics and pain meds, and other custom compounded pharmacy meds. She set up quick follow up appts.",Female
She is a wonderful dr. I'm so very upset to see her go. She has always be straight  to the point and honest with me. I'm having a really hard time letting her go. She is amazing after all I have been threw. Just simply the best. Would recommend anyone to her and I have too. I totally trust in all her decisions. ,Female
"Had to see Dr. Ha while my regular PCP wasn’t available. Her approach was to copy and paste last year’s notes in my chart; she looked at some of the test results and suggested these may be signs of cancer and referred me another specialist, just like this right off the bat! Btw, this “other specialist” I ended up seeing said that the referring physician doesn’t know how to read results of the most primitive urine test...",Female
"Dr. Ha was nothing but professional, kind, and extra thorough during our appointment. She had a good sense of humor and put me at ease. I have the utmost confidence in her and her expertise. I find many of the negative reviews on here questionable given my experience with her and other PCP’s in the past. It is hard to find a good PCP and I look forward to being her patient for many years to come.",Female

Dr Ha is very inexperienced, rude and always manages to overcharge me on my insurance (and I have to have 10% of her charges up to my deductible limit.

It was very aggressive and if I hadn't been so lucky to have such a compassionate and caring doctor there's no doubt in my mind I would not be here today with my son.

"I recently had a breast augmentation with Dr. Ha. During my consultation he seemed extremely annoyed any time I would ask a question which only lasted 5 mins or so. Most of his great reviews are back from 2013-2015 before he was featured in D Magazine. Clearly, all of this attention has gotten to his head and ego! He is cold, lacks compassion, and ill-mannered.

He rushed through our visit, spending less than 5 minutes with my daughter (despite our 2 hour drive) and did not give clear instructions for scar care for my daughter's cleft repair.

When the cream would cost over 2,000 dollars and I called for an alternative he offered little help and it took a week to even get a call back.",Male

 she didn’t wear he gloves when she  about to check my son and wanted me to leave her with my son in the room alone with her when he is just 10 years old..Is very unsafe to visit this place specially with this pandemic.I had to walk out without my son being seen I was very concerned about his safety.I don’t recommend this place to anyone..Please don’t bring your little ones here or yourself..",Female

"Dr. Ha was very thorough in his examination and questions to me. 
He pinpointed my problem immediately and confirmed it through an MRI.  After a few injections and recommendation of stretching exercises, I feel like I’m on my way to a full recovery.  ",Male
"My Mom was having pain in her hips,leg and back. Dr Ha gave her series of injections and she is walking without any pain.Dr Ha is so kind and patient with everyone but especially with elderly people.He takes the time needed to explain everything he is going to do .His bedside manner far exceeds any Dr I have seen in a long time.His major concern is to help get his patients out of pain.Thank you for all you did for my Mom.I have recommended you to all my family and friends.",Male

Hall also has a very good diet plan for individuals that are overweight and he is a very caring physician and the diet will help you with your arthritis,Male
"Dr. Ha took care of my mom's pain issues with spinal steroid injections localized to the specific area of pain, as well as diet recommendations to reduce paid and inflammation.  He is very positive and goal-oriented to remediating the pain issues on a permanent basis.  He is witty, kind, and respectful of his elderly patients.  His staff is also great.  We would definitely recommend him to anyone who is dealing with pain issues.",Male
"Excellent doctor.  I've been a nurse for 45 years and he is one of the finest doctors I have ever seen.  Helped my pain and arthritis with a change in diet and life style, no medications.  Office staff is also excellent.",Male
An outstanding Dr.  My first visit was pleasant and enjoyable.  He helps you understand your pain and gives options to help deal with it to enjoy your life to the fullest  He is very knowledgeable  and his staff is very friendly.  I would recommend Dr. Trung Ha to anyone.  Thank you Sandra.,Male

"Dr Ha impressed me by reading up on me before our first visit. 
I could not walk when I entered his  office. 
That was corrected after my second appointment. I had been told nothing could be done with my knee and hip until  I lost at least 100 lb.  Dr Ha gave me a list of food to help inflammation of the joints and it also helped me to lose 30 lb in 2 months. 
I am still painfree after 3 months and we’ll on my way to my knee  and/or hip replacement if needed. Thanks Dr Ha.",Male
"I started seeing Dr Ha a little over a month ago. He immediately put me on his anti-inflammatory diet. It’s really not that hard to follow because it’s a lot like how I try to eat anyway. He’s slowly taking me off all my pain meds and I’m feeling great. I highly recommend Dr Ha. He genuinely cares about you. If you are in a lot of pain, go see Dr Ha. ",Male
"I started seeing Dr. Ha following a car accident in which left me with a shoulder and hand injury, and was in a great deal of pain.  After being turned away from three other pain medicine physicians, my primary care physician suggested that Dr. Ha would be willing to treat me. 
Not only has Dr. Ha  has given me days without pain! After two years of the day to day agony and inability to use my arm/shoulder properly, Dr. Ha  has been successful in my treatment plan.  Best decision ever!",Male
"I went to Dr. Ha for pain and told was I am not good about taking meds. He put me on an anti inflammation diet and asked me to do it for a month faithfully then return after the month. The first week I had a sick headache, dizzy, weak, stayed hungry and at the end of the week I started crying and decided to stop this diet. The next morning I changed my mind and pushed through it so I could prove him wrong but instead it not only worked, I have lost weight and feel great. Thanks Dr. Ha ",Male
"Celestino Monroy
He’s the best doctor.he treats you good.when I walked in I was in crutches two months later I was walking without crutches he gives me the right medication and I follow the diet he put on and I lost 40 pounds  I feels good thanks DOCTOR HA",Male
"I was recommended to Dr. Ha by my primary care physician and was pleasantly surprised at his understanding of my pain and how to relieve it. After several procedures, he was finally able to locate the cause of my pain and suggested the procedures for relieving it. After two procedures he was finally able to relieve the pain and I am absolutely thrilled to be pain free. Thank you Dr. Ha!",Male
"Dr. Ha is an incredible surgeon and doctor. I went to see him for back pain and leg pain, and he recommended surgery in his outpatient surgery center. They were great at the surgery center and glad I didn't have to go to the hospital for the surgery. Dr. Ha creates a relationship with the patient. Surgery was a success and no more leg or back pain. Thank you Dr. Ha, it's great having a Dr. like you who really cares about his patients.",Male
"I was in severe pain prior to Dr Ha operating on me. After a 4+ hour operation I walked out of the building and have not had a hint of any pain since. It literally changed my life. 
Dr Ha is a world class surgeon and his facility is impeccably run.",Male
"I am very pleased with the service and bedside manner of Dr. Ha. He is an extraordinary surgeon that is confident, competent, and skilled at his chosen craft. I had a double cervical disc replacement done a year ago and couldn't be happier with the results. Dr. Ha spent the time needed to explain what he was going too do and why it should be done. I couldn't be happier with the life Dr. Ha gave back to me because of this highly successful procedure.",Male
"Went from debilitating pain, paraesthesias and sciatica after a herniated disc to a normal, functional and healthy life again. Concerned about spine surgery, Dr Ha’s intelligent explanation put my mind at ease!
Thanks you, Doc!",Male
I'd had sciatica for 10 years before being brave enough to do anything about it. Seeing Dr. Ha was a breath of fresh air. He told me he could fix that after looking at the MRI and scheduled surgery. His staff was fast and very friendly. I never had any pain after the surgery and took no pain meds. Sciatic pain was gone after surgery and there is no pain still after 3 weeks. What a blessing. Dr. Ha is a miracle worker.,Male
"Dr. Ha is the doctor you always hope for but rarely get. He is patient and he is kind. He is also honest and straight forward about the risks and potential outcome of your surgery. He has put together a high functioning group of talented people who care for you with joy and encouragement. His approach is holistic in nature, so be forewarned; if you smoke a pack a day, if you are obese or if your outlook on life is negative,  you might have to make changes. It is well worth the effort.",Male
"Dr. Ha has performed two surgeries for me.  In both instances he carefully explained the results from the MRI and explained the options available.  Both surgeries were successful, relieving the related pain and limitation.  The nurses, anesthesiologist, and Dr. Ha were all professional and kind throughout the process.  I have every confidence in Dr. Ha and his team. ",Male
"I am very happy with results of C5-C6, C6-C7 Total Disc Replacement surgery performed by Dr. Ha. 5 weeks ago.  He took the time to explain what was causing my issues.  In addition, he was very clear in establishing post-surgery expectations before moving forward.  I experienced almost instant relief after surgery, and am feeling better each week.  I highly recommend Dr. Ha, and found him and his staff professional and helpful.",Male
"Dr. Ha performed back surgery on me while stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.  After months of Physical Therapy not improving my pain, an MRI, Dr. Ha scheduled my surgery before he took personal leave. I was free of pain and back on my feet.  Dr. Ha was so professional, answered all my questions, and I felt confident of his competency to perform my surgery.  I highly recommend him to anyone requiring a Neurosurgeon.",Male
"I had Dr. Ha perform a micro discectomy of my L5-S1 and the whole procedure was amazing. I was in debilitating pain due to the disc herniation and after the surgery I had no pain at all. 

Dr Ha is professional, kind and extremely knowledgeable. Dr. Ha spent several years as an Army neurosurgeon and being a veteran myself I felt very comfortable having him as my doctor. He is honest with his patients and does not strike me as someone who would rush to surgery without making sure it was the right",Male
"
I had ACDF surgery due to a work injury. I had been suffering from intense nerve pain all up and down my arm. From the moment I met him I appreciated his knowledge and compassion. He made me feel very safe in his care. I trusted him immediately. I am amazed how great I feel already! I know it will take time for my nerves to heal, but I’m on the road to recovery!",Male
"Get a second opinion if you see Dr Ha! He told me I needed surgery on my neck to fuse 3 vertebrae. He said it was urgent or I'd lose the use of my arm. When I asked, he said physical therapy wouldn't work.  I went to Seattle and saw a different neurosurgeon and she said I definitely DON'T need surgery! PT and perhaps a steroid shot will fix the issues I've been having. 
Also, Dr Ha said the surgery he was recommending for me couldn't be done orthoscopilally. Wrong!",Male
"5 stars are not near enough to give Dr. Ha. He is an excellent surgeon, extremely caring, very compassionate and very down to earth. From the first consultation to the post op visit, Dr. Ha explained in detail, at my level of understanding, everything about the surgery. I knew exactly what to expect from pre-op through the long term relationship of post op. This is not a surgeon who operates and then moves on to the next patient. He cares about my recovery. Immediate relief of all symptoms.",Male
"Dr Ha has been a life saver, he performed single level disc surgery at C5/6 with prodisc C after a severe disc herniation; gave me 7 years of perfect pain free life. I am an active duty military member and despite my injury, Dr Ha was able to get me back to work and perfect function within a month (jumping, rucking, weights, etc) Extremely competent and great bedside manner, rightfully takes great pride in his work, he is indeed a perfectionist.",Male
He has been the best surgeon I could ever ask for. I was almost died until he saved my life. Yeah I may not be able to use my left side movement the best but I'm alive and happy. Thanks for the best!,Male
"I had a bad experience with a failed fusion. Dr. Ha refused to acknowledge the fact that his surgery had failed and I ultimately ended up having to find a different (much more competent, less arrogant) surgeon at the Swideish Neuroscience Institute. They pointed out the fact that all of my screw were stripped from Dr. Ha's attempt and that the plate was not properly positioned. I had severe metalosis throughout my spinal cord and now deal with life altering side effects.",Male
"I had my surgery on Dec. 16, 2016 by the wonderful well gifted Dr. Ha. The day of my office visit, I found Dr. Ha very professional and patient friendly. Bringing my husband back to see Dr. Ha, we agreed for Dr. Ha to do a ACDF on my C4 – C7 on my neck. Surgery day, I was comforted by the staff, impatient and surgery staff. Dr. Ha was by my side all the way. Today I have my voice back, no swallowing problems and my upper and lower parts of my body are back to normal.  Thank you Dr. Ha and staff!",Male
"Dr. Ha diagnosed my condition, and was able to clearly explain the problem using my x-rays and MRI.  He thoroughly went over everything that he could see in the MRI with me in language that I understood.  
After I decided on the surgery, my insurance didn't want to cover the procedure.  Dr. Ha called me on the phone and explained other options. 
Dr. Ha is a caring, compassionate, and considerate man, and I am grateful that he was able to do my surgery.  I would absolutely recommend him!!!",Male
"I can't comment on his surgery, since I ""fired"" him before the operation.  His comments prior to the surgery can be summarized as: ""I was old (71), so it was very risky for me to do any activity but for mild walking.  This included any type of gym workout, golf, sex, etc.  Also, I didn't need all of that muscle and core strength, so I should lose 75 pounds (down to my fighting weight in college), and stop my gym workouts.  I felt I couldn't trust him to give good advice and care, going forward.",Male
"My name Gerry McNamara  had neck  surgery 3 weeks ago right out of surgery , within 4 hours i could use my left arm again, witch had been to painful to move for over 2 months and both my arms were working relatively pain free after surgery ,now i can get back my normal life again golf and riding my bike .thank you doctor Ha and your team of people .",Male

"Dr. Ha is the best.... he is very personable .  MOst importantly, he is a clinical expert in derm.  He can diagnose a condition accurately in seconds and is very thorough.  My sister comes from Paris France just to see him he is that good.  I would highly recommend this practice even if you have to wait for an appointment.  Its worth the wait!",Male

"I have been with Dr. Ha for 20 years. He is consistently professional, thorough and kind. I can't think of another doctor, ever, who has given my family and me that level of service. What also makes every interaction easy is his staff. Simply the best. Never an attitude - just real people doing their jobs with the highest level of professional behavior and....fun.",Male
easy,Male

Dr Ha has provided me with excellent medical care with professional and trusted support for almost two decades.  I can't imagine receiving better medical care.,Male
"Fantastic Dr, he’s always professional, knowledgeable, and everything you’d want in a Dr. ",Male
"Worst bedside manner of any medical professional I've dealt with. Didn't introduce himself, look at me, palpate, nothing.",Male
Dr T is my primary care physician and he is awesome! He will not give up until your diagnosis is complete and you are on the road to recovery. Very knowledgeable and methodical. I highly recommend!,Male
Dr. Haab is one physician I'll never see again. He doesn't take time or listen he rushes and is always behind. Another problem I've had is scheduling an appointment. He's never there and is always taking vacations or leave. Never had that problem with my old physician. His staff is rude and they all are there just for a pay check. These people don't care.,Male
"     Truly an exceptional doctor:  no ""God Complex,"" and more importantly he knows how to treat people with courtesy and respect--probably because he started his medical career as a nurse.  Since his first specialty was as an Emergency Medicine Doctor he is incredibly well-versed in all facets of patient care that a general practitioners may encounter on a daily basis.  I think the strongest recommendation I can give him is that I trust him not only with my health but that of my family as well.",Male
"I feel like he didn't listen to me when I was explaining my symptoms. My issue was with my lungs and my heart, but he didn't seem too concerned about that. After dicking around with him for several appointments, I had to go see another doctor who ordered a bunch of tests. after waiting for a half hour to get into the exam room, then another 30-35 minutes to see him, it is a little disheartening to only spend 10 minutes with him. This is how all of my appts have been with him.",Male
Dr. Hacck was god sent for me. She didn't stop till she helped me with what had been going on for years. Very kind and patient young lady. I will always be appreciate for her help. Ms. Harrison,Female
She is very kind and genuine.  Her experience and bed side manner are outstanding.  I would recommend her to anyone and know they would be in good hands.  Thank you Dr. Haack.??,Female
VERY FINE DOCTOR,Male
I agree with the first few reviews. She is arrogant and does not listen to patients needs. We will be terminating our relationship with her!!!,Female
"She pushed for my daughter to go on birth control simply because she is a teenager. She also pushed for the HPV vaccine for both of my kids. I expressed my concerns over certain things that I had read about this NEW vaccine. She was more than condescending! She said that whatever I had read could not be accurate. She then took my daughter aside in the hallway and told her that she didn't need me, and could choose to bar me from the exam room. Completely disrespectful and undermining to parent-child relationship!",Female
"She is indifferent, and has no respect for specialists.   Also she is disrespectful to her patients.  Has allot to learn about being a good doctor.  Does not listen to my concerns or willing to discuss them.  Totally miss diagnosis. ",Female
"I totally agree with the first review above.  She is condescending and arrogant.  When ever another specialist as a different different diagnosis than her, she says "" oh, he's not a very good doctor.""  These doctors are specialist in their field and have been practicing for 15 to 20 years.  And how long has Miss Hack, oops, been practicing?  6 yrs, graduated in 2013.",Female
Misdiagnosis and general indifference toward my needs. Dr. Haack is condescending and arrogant. She did not confer with other clinicians and completely missed a major medical condition. The name fits the level of service.,Female
"Very pleasant, professional and knowledgeable. ",Female
"He was thorough. Good bedside manner, very good at explaining what was going on and why he recommended what he did. Would 100% recommend him to someone who needed an ENT.",Male
I highly recommend this physician. ,Male
"I have been going to Dr. Haack for many years now and really like him as a doctor.  He is very thorough, explains things very well and is easy to talk to.  At first, his staff was very good, but in the last year or so have seen a decline.  When you call for an appointment, they act like they don't care and trying to get an appointment when you have an ear infection or sore throat is nearly impossible as the wait time is almost a month.  They also won't bother to call you back either.  ",Male
"Dr Haack is one of the best Drs I've seen, he takes the time to sit down with you and explain everything.I had been having trouble breathing and had reoccuring sinus infections and I had put off going to see a Dr about my condition because I was so afraid of having sinus surgery but when I finally did go,Dr Haak helped me through my fears. I highly recommend Dr Haak",Male
"I left two separate messages for Dr. Haack's office and never received a call back.  Dr. Haack is a great doctor, but it's very difficult to get an appointment.  The first message I left was for the Office Manager about an insurance coding question, and the second message was regarding setting up an appointment.  As I mentioned, I never received any return calls, so I booked an appointment at the University of Utah Medical Clinics.   I will not go back to that clinic because of his staff.",Male
"Wonderful and compassionate, takes time in answering questions and concerns. very patient with explaining things that you don't understand.",Male
Ridiculous wait times to get an appointment.  Staff doesn't appear to care if patient is very sick or not - they still book you out a month.  I suppose if the patient dies in the mean time due to the wait they might get an opening.,Male
"Very professional and knowledgeable.
Listening skill are great. Treats you like family and makes you feel comfortable when your worried.",Female
Quality medical services resulting in better quality of life.,Male
"Selected Dr Haack due to his ratings, however, my wife found the experience with this Dr and his staff to be quite different.  To be brief, Dr did not have time to accommodate “peer to peer” review with United Healthcare to approve CT.  We had terrible experience with Kristen in working out some path to getting the CT approved.  She was very unprofessional.  We have good reason to suspect something is wrong with my wife’s health, but not important enough if it requires preferring an X-ray first, or responding to the insurance company’s request for follow up.",Male
Very thorough and knowledgeable. I appreciate his manner and concern. His staff goes above and beyond as well. ,Male
Dr. Haack listened closely to my situation. Some recent doctors have reached a conclusion before I finish my sentence. Dr. Haack was clear as he described my condition and his recommended treatment in lay terms. I was very pleased with his thorough assessment and knowledge. I highly recommend his professional manner with an inherent ability to relax the anxious patient. He also recommended a nutrionist when I mentioned that concern in passing. A truly concerned and learned physician. ,Male
Dr. Haack has really taken care of my father who is suffering from Myasthenia Gravis.  He takes time with him at each visit and was very caring and patient with me when I was difficult.  He is an exceptional doctor who genuinely cares for his patients. ,Male
She is a  Great doctor love how she  listens and asked a lot of questions..,Female
"I was admitted to Bay Area Hospital with severe chest pain. Dr. Haack was the the physician on call.  My wife and I found her extremely competent, forthright, articulate, knowledgable, patient, willing to take the time to answer our questions in language we could understand and humorous.  Dr. Haack, thank you for your expertise in caring for me in my time of emergency. Couldn't hope for anyone better!  
  ",Female
After working 40 yrs and a heart attack and being put on the OHP plan I was referred to this doctor by the hospital ICU staff.   It took 7 months to get an appt. with her.  I have seen her twice since July 2017 because Rhonda and Allison the office staff do not let me see her.  The recent incident included surgery on a carotid artery and a possible seizure. These women would not let me see her and made it so I could not see her again.  I believe it has to do with OHP. They do not take this ins.,Female
Dr Haack is an awesome doctor. In one day she reviewed my medical history and knew all my conditions before even stepping into her office. She looks at everything carefully and listens to me. She’s just awesome!,Female
"Dr Haacke was my dad's pulmonologist for several years.  My dad had lung nodules which have a high tendency to become cancerous.  In Sept 2018 his annual scans showed changes from the previous year.  Further scans done in Oct 2018 showed many areas of concern for cancer.  Dr. Haacke's office  failed to follow up with my father leaving him to believe that everything was ok.  

In March 2019 he sought chiropractic care for pain in his neck.  The chiropractor ordered imaging which showed that my father had cancer in 4 places including his lungs.  We would later find out that my dad had stage 4 lung cancer that spread to his cervical spine, bowel, shoulder and hip bones.  On April 1, 2019, the cancer broke his neck leaving him paralyzed from the neck down.  On June 4, 2019 he died.

Dr. Haacke FAILED to meet the standard of care.  The standard of care called for repeat scans in 4-6 weeks or tissue sampling. Haacke did NOTHING.  If caught earlier my dad might have had more time, less pain.",Female
I’ve seen Dr. Haacke couple times due to Shortness of breath and crackling  when breathing.. it took 2 1/2 weeks to get test results back when the office is right in the same building.. the assistant made me feel like I was a bother when trying to get some answers..still don’t know why I’m crackling.. some of my readings on test were low they said don’t worry about it..no answers!! Going to go somewhere else that really cares and most importantly tell you to come in and explains what test meant!,Female
I went there with issues being caused by a constant cough. She scheduled numerous tests. I had to keep calling to see if they had results.  After she saw me the second time with still diagnosis she said she'd see me in 6 months. I finally just left after spending several thousands of dollars on tests she never gave me any idea what was causing my issues.,Female
"She's a great Doctor, and really listens to your concerns. She ordered quite a few tests, and was able to tell me exactly what was wrong.",Female
"Dr Haacke is wonderful. I met her approximately 8 yrs ago. My future was looking pretty dim and I was on a lot of medications. She re-evaluated me and my meds. She has stabilized my COPD and knows exactly what to do when it flares up. I trust her with my life an am so grateful she is my Dr. Her office staff is amazing, as well. They have been with her as long as I have been going there an it's very apparent they are happy working with and for her. I can't praise Dr Haacke enough!!",Female
Very concerned doctor and person who listens to your statements before directing your care. Up to date on medical information.,Male
"He has been my doctor for over 16 years. He is the BEST, most compassionate doctor I have ever met. I have several health issues and he has been with me every step of the way. He knows my health issues well. He listens, takes his time and genuinely cares for his patients. I am devastated he is leaving for concierge care and will miss him tremendously. I only hope and pray to find a doctor half as good as him. I really can't say anything negative as he has always been my health advocate. I wish you the best Dr.Haacke-Golden.",Male
BEST DOCTOR HANDS DOWN. HE IS SO CARING AND AWESOME. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR MY FAMILY. HE CALLED US PERSONALLY TO CHECK IN ON MY HUSBAND WHEN HE WAS SICK AND WAS VERY HELPFUL IN HIS TREATMENT THE WHOLE TIME. JUST AN AMAZING GUY!,Male
"Dr. Hake-Golden is the ONLY reason I stay with this practice for the last decade. He is intuitive and compassionate. He has really improved my health because his protocol’s include lifestyle recommendations, not just medication. He attends to the whole system, not just the organ involved. The practice, on the other hand, is consistently a challenge to my loyalty. They are, in general, rude and difficult. Reception is always as if you are disturbing their day with your illness and pain. ",Male
"Dr Haacke-Golden is focused on you, the patient. we does not jump to prescription medicine as a solution, in fact it has been my experience that he prefers not to. If there are other remedies, like specific foods, supplements, or therapy, he will go there first. 

I have been going to him for over 10 years and highly recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Haacke-Golden and his nurse are exceptional! At my appointment, I feel like they take the time to LISTEN!
The employee that draws the blood is exceptional. The only medical office that I know of is better!!!",Male
"Dr. Haacke-Golden is the best.  He is thorough, yet efficient.  He listened carefully and seemed really interested in my well-being.  Although he is extremely busy, he did not appear rushed and made certain that I had time to ask questions and get answers. His plan of care was practical. I greatly appreciated the fact that he and his staff got back to me with the results of my tests and labs. ",Male
Dr. Haacke-Golden is a very caring exceptional physician.   He is genuinely concerned and an excellent communicator.  I look forward to his care for many years to come.,Male
"Dr, Haacke-Golden is an excellent doctor - he is concerned about his patients, and he takes the time to listen to them, no matter how busy he is.  He has a superb bedside manner, and is neither critical nor judgmental. He is extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date, and seems to truly care about his patients.  I wish I had found Dr. Haacke-Golden years ago; he is kind, understanding, sympathetic, concerned, and I would recommend him to family and friends without hesitation! Rating A+++++ PERFECT",Male
Dr. Haacker  is an excellent professional. He is caring and understanding with his patients. He takes time explaining in details. ,Male

"Following a recommendation from my Family Doctor more than 20 years ago, I have been treated by Dr. Haaff at least yearly since then, as well as for both a vasectomy and prostate issues.  Dr. Haaff listens to the patient and answers all questions.  In my experience he is an outstanding Urology physician in all respects.",Male
"If you are not in a hurry to to get your test results than perhaps he would be the Dr for you. It only took 11 days, multiple calls and even got my bill before he finally responded.",Male
Explains conditions and treatment options as to make them understood. Is not rushed and takes time to engage.,Male
I like Dr. Haag.  He does not under treat me so I am suffering longer than needed with some illness and he does not over treat me so I am knocked out for a period of time.  He has even treated things more professionally than some specialty doctors.,Male
"Extremely impatient if questioned about his treatment process. Elderly patients seem to be at a disadvantage if they desire further explanation of their treatment or prescribed medications.  “Refer to the paper that comes with the meds”.  If a complaint is made through the agency, be aware, he is part owner, which allows him to do as he pleases. ",Male
Dr. Haag is the best doctor that has ever treated me.  His knowledge and professionalism was impressive.  I am so very thankful to him for all of his efforts.  I would recommend him to anyone.,Male
"Dr. Haag was frequently in a hurry.  The information he gave was good, but I felt rushed once I got in to see him.",Male
"Being a health insurance agent and a patient of Dr. Haag, I not only recommend him to all of my clients that don't have a primary care physician, but to those that do also.  Hands down the best doctor that I have ever had.  Very proactive and concerned with your health.  Goes above and beyond what any other doctor has done for me.  Top notch.",Male
"Considerate, accessible, knowledgeable, etc. Dr. Haag is a very fine person and a better surgeon. He cared for a family member of mine and we couldn't have been happier with his bedside manner or the quality of the care he provided. I would recommend him to anyone.",Male

Dr. Haag was our family doctor through the 1980's at his Elmer New Jersey office.

the rest of your life. He said that doesn't make sense. He needs to get to people's medical files. I'm going to a different Dr. I felt like he didn't cared. I have never had a Dr make me this way..",Male

"Sorry to hear you had a  bad experience with the practice.  I have been seeing Dr. Iacobelli's for over 20 years and all I have to say is that he is the most knowledgable dermatologist I have found.  He treated me for severe acne when I spent many years and thousands of dollars trying to fix it. Some years later my daughter had a severe case of eczema and Doctor Icabolellis was able to cure it for good despite several doctors' opinions that my daughter needed to learn to live with it.
 I think he is moving more to the cosmetic field but I trust his judgment with severe cases.",Male
"Dr. Iacobellis likes to burn everything, even when other dermatologists say that is not appropriate.  Also likes to call back, so you pay for extra visits.  And, does not tell you when Medicare turns something down, so you can appeal the billing. Stay away!",Male
"A careless and uncaring medical mill. I went to Dr. Iacebellis's office in 2017 but never met the doctor. A nurse practitioner took a biopsy and told me to come back for results. When I returned on the date specified, she didn't have results or a diagnosis. I never received a diagnosis and had to pressure the office to send me the test results. Dr. Iacobellis remained MIA. His office sent my biopsy to one of the few labs that didn't take my insurance, so I paid over $1300 for non-treatment.",Male
"I made an appointment with him as I wanted a second opinion about certain moles. I pointed out one mole in the front, who was already diagnosed as a carcinoma and he agreed, and two in the back. He barely looked at the ones in the back and told me they were nothing. I just did a biopsy and confirmed that both are carcinomas and I have to remove them ASAP.  He didn't identified them as carcinomas when I even pointed them out for him!!",Male
"My visit to Dr. Iacobellis was fine at first. I scheduled an appointment and waited a nominal time. Dr. Iacobellis had great bedside manners and was seemingly very helpful. He prescribed my medicine with several refills. The problem was when I wanted to get my refills, my pharmacy needed to contact my Dr. Iacobellis' office to confirm my medication and they refused. Please beware that this office is not helpful. They blatantly only want your money and don't even let you get your refills.",Male

Over the years he helped me to understand my anxiety and be able to work through it, not fear it. I would not be the person I am today if it was not for him helping me. And now, years later, I am off all of my medications and living my best life. I am truly happy and feel like I understand what I am feeling, rather than just fear it. I am truly grateful to him and the help he has provided to me.",Male
"This doctor asks one general question at the beginning of the 20 minutes, then he turns the conversation into a discussion about himself.  I sit and listen to him talk about nothing important for the remainder of the time.  I've tried to refocus him, but it's useless. He's in his own world. I'd leave United Services, but there's nowhere else to go.  NE CT is drastically lacking in quality behavioral healthcare.

On our very first visit he evaluated my mother and weened her off of the medication she was on and prescribed her a new medication that totally changed hers and our world.

Unfortunately through the phone, I can tell this guy was either a pompous a-hole or an incompetent delinquent. He asked me right off the back what I needed in the nastiest, unwanted tone. Interrupted me when I spoke. This is my first time looking for help and certainly received the worse experience with this guy and this isn’t even in person.",Male

Needless to say, I highly highly highly recommend Dr. Iacobello to anyone with depression and/or anxiety problems that wants to work towards a long-term resolution.",Male
"He helped me very much with my panic attacks and my mood swings and come off some medications that were making me really sick.  He approach emotions from the pont of view that they need to be acknowledged and expressed and not suppressed.  
He told me that suppressing them only feeds them more. ",Male
"He treated me with no respect and expected me to tell my whole life story within one session. His attitude was more than unprofessional. When we changed our appointment about twice he threatened to drop us as clients and at that point I was perfectly okay with that. We looked for a new physiatrist and he sent us a note saying that I didn’t participate in treatment correctly and that we were going to be dropped from his treatment. I would never recommend going to him, find someone else.",Male
"Deep.  That is what I would use to describe the level of care, knowledge and expertise you will find.  I have been a patient for years.  I was in a place where I couldn't even leave the house without crippling panic attacks.  Now, I'm to the point where I feel I have my life back and I can do whatever I want again.  You have to be willing to put in the time and the effort.  You will see results. Trust the process and show up every visit. It will be worth it.  Nothing comes easy. ",Male

After one hour with this dishonest man I was outta there.   You've been warned!  Absolutely not! ",Male
"Dr. Iacobello has a ""common sense"" approach to his practice.  He is patient, extremely responsive, and always reminds me to contact him between appointments, if need be.  Additionally, Dr. Iacobello has a ""contact representative"" who can facilitate any issue - ranging from general appointment concerns, or a critical need to contact someone who will be sensitive and facilitate any response which is required.  I find this reassuring and helpful beyond measure.",Male
"Dr Iacobello treated me with EMDR against my consent, which I'm pretty sure is illegal. He also prescribed me a very heavy antipsychotic on the first visit, something later doctors told me is a medicinal straight jacket and rarely used. He was rude and aggressive-- not just his accent and his tone as he tries to claim in responses. I felt uncomfortable in his office. If it weren't past the statute of limitations I would be pursuing malpractice.",Male
"I only had one appointment and decided this wasn't a right fit for me. Dr. Iacobello seemed disorganized and his style of getting my history didn't seem so effective. He asked maybe four questions and had me ramble on. I suppose I'm used to standard intake questionnaires and if he had this he probably would have a more complete history. I'm sure there are patients who will find him adequate, but I'm looking for someone with an open mind and open ears. ",Male

Dr. James took no time to get me involved with physical therapy when he felt my copd had reached a bad point.

The results are more than I could’ve hoped for, as I was told I wouldn’t be able to achieve the natural look I wanted with just one surgery by another surgeon. I am so glad I got a second opinion and scheduled a consultation with him! He is kind, patient and very thorough. I found his down-to-earth demeanor very reassuring - so important - in such vulnerable moments as one would expect inquiring about plastic surgery for the first time. I was pretty nervous about it! No matter, that faded quickly! The office staff are super sweet, efficient, and actual caring people not robots. I enjoy going in there for my post-op appointments as everyone is such a joy. Everything has been such a smooth experience with outstanding results from beginning, middle and end! Thanks Dr. Iacobucci and staff! &lt;3",Male

Dr. Iacabucci is an amazing physician and wonderful surgeon.  He cared for my son who had a oseoma involving the frontal sinus and eye orbits. He reassured us from the beginning that he would take care of him and he and his wonderful office staff did just that. He was 15 then and is now 28 yrs old. The surgery was extensive and today you would never know looking at his face that any surgery had been performed.  We are forever in his debt and would refer him without question to anyone.,Male

Unlike many doctors who rush in and out of the room, Dr Iacobucci spent a very long time with my husband and I, explaining in detail what would happen during the mastectomy surgery and the journey that would follow to complete reconstruction. He has been very professional, patient and kind. He is very much a perfectionist, and has provided great results.",Male

He was able to locate a suitable single donated lung, which was, thereafter, transplanted into my right chest cavity, and, this successful transplant saved my life.
        As if that wasn't enough, Dr. Iacono  saved my life a SECOND time. In
January, 2020, I contracted the flu, and, feeling very ill, Dr. Iacono ordered me to immediately get to UMHC, where he determined that I not only had the flu but also a yeast infection AND pneumonia. I would not have survived without
the intervention of Dr. Iacono. He's the BEST!",Male

"Denied to see me as a new patient because the medications I was taking (prescribed by a Psychiatrist and Physician) went against his ""guidelines"". The doctor, nor his staff, wouldn't even tell me which medication(s) he took exception to.",Male

"I was referred to Dr Iacoviello by my Urogynecologist after long difficulties managing chronic recurrent UTIs.   Dr Iacoviello has succeeded in greatly reducing UTI incidents with his recommended treatment plans.   He has been excellent in explaining options, a very good and patient listener.   The only drawbacks are minor:   office hours limitations can be a minor difficulty;  also the process for dropping off lab specimens required by hospital red tape is very very inconvenient.",Male

" I have  recommended Dr. Frank Iacovone to my family and friends.  Aside from being highly trained in the field of cardiology,  he  is by far the most compassionate, caring physician I have been to.    I listened to Dr. Iacovone's advice with regards to my health, and I am  happy to say that he was absolutely correct with his diagnosis and treatment for me.   Thank you Dr. Iacovone for caring about your patients!!!!!",Male
"His office told me to go through the emergency room to have my test done because they had not gotten insurance approval yet.  I just learned that the test was DENIED by the insurance company, not that they hadn't received it.  Because of this lie, it cost me over $4,000 in hospital costs.",Male
"Dr Iaderosa, as a well qualified internal medicine physician, takes a personal interest in each and every patient.  He follows up with phone calls on lab or other diagnostic tests.  The hand picked office staff at each location offers ancillary services such as counseling for Diabetes, and also helps with arranging home medical equipment and many other services so that bewildered patients don't have to be frustrated by trying to find help on their own.",Male
"I've never been to any placet han Henry Ford. Dr idarosa worked into locations so I ended up also frequenting the location on in Mount Clemens since I was about 12. last time I was in I actually saw the the newest doctor Dr Abby and I just started a new job as a care manager at a retirement facility.
So short staffed Im getting 3 hrs of sleep and so stressed out cleaning rear ends and trying to keep dementia grandma and grandpas from hurting themselves I'm getting constant cold sores! I left a message to get a script for it since the last time I was there they said it was in my file. No one returned my call at all. I called a week later and they gave me run around and would not give me the script which they have to have on file because I won't come in..I don't go anywhere else.. well sure as hell I will now!. Since that's what I get for being loyal my whole life!!!. I have a clean bill of health due to my recent physical for this new job.. Dr Abbi just wants money obviously",Male
"I went to see him for severe pain after waiting for an hour and a half I was finally called into a room. He spent exactly 3 seconds with me when I asked about the procedure and if he thought it would work to get a shot in my back he said ""I don't know"". He never explained the procedure to me. I have heard from a few other people who have gone to him that he is just as abrupt with them. I wouldn't recommend him to anyone. He was very rude and not concerned with my severe pain.",Male
5 stars,Male
Dr. I has helped me over the last 4 years. Early on he tried one type of injection that provided some relief. Later on he explained another procedure that would require a try run. This proved positive and I have been much better going on two years.  This was for lumbar.  I have been to him recently for cervical pain and he helped me improve at least 80%.  I recommend him.,Male

"I delivered a stillborn fall 2015 after being hospitalized at the clinic for 4nights. I will never forget the condescending tone and disregard for my labor pains this doctor dismissed as irritability. I had never met him prior but he was the attending the night my son past, I only wish he had taken my pain more seriously. To be fair I don't know if the outcome would have been different however to have a physician speak so brash and be dismissive, to the point I cried when he left my room.",Male
"Dr.Iafrate performed the Tenex procedure on my shoulder to remove painful calcium deposits and treat my tendenosis and bursitis . She was very thorough in her examination , very caring , compassionate , and competent . She takes an interest in her patients and their families that is not a usual occurrence from my experience with other physicians.The procedure saved me from going under the knife and a more extensive recovery period . She also administered two PRP injections to help quicken the recovery and small tears in the rotator cuff . My pain level is low compared to before the procedure and strength is coming back slowly . Shoulders tendons don't have much blood supply so patience is a virtue in dealing with a longer recovery period than for other injuries. I would recommend Dr. Iafrate for any sports related injury. Her background in dance brings a complete perspective on sports injuries and conservative  treatment options available. I would see her again in heartbeat if needed .",Female
"I only waited 3 minutes past my appointment time, which really is nothing when speaking of doctors and their schedules. She got straight to the issue and discussed treatment options. She was really kind and gave a very thorough / thoughhtful recommendation. She is down to earth, listens, and always has a game-plan for next steps. I was very impressed with her and my visit. I would highly recommend her.",Female
"I was referred to Dr. Iafrate from another sports medicine physiatrist in the ColumbiaDoctors group.  Dr. J has extensive experience and expertise caring for athletes and professional dancers. I am neither, but wanted to be treated like a professional for a longstanding tendonosis problem (that providers at HSS were unable to help me with - PRP didn't help at all). Dr. J listened, carefully examined me, and thouroughly discussed treatment options including pros and cons. I had a fantastic result following the tenotomy procedure.",Female
"Dr. Iafrate is easily one of the most expert and caring doctors I have ever seen. (And my gosh have I seen a lot of doctors.)

I spent a year with constant nerve pain in my shoulder from a mysterious shoulder injury. I couldn't move my arm, I would get numbness and shooting pains. I couldn't sleep or exercise.
I have bipolar depression, so the pain and lack of sleep were severely impacting my life. I almost lost my job. I had a relationship end. I was in a very dark and dangerous place.

Over the course of that year, I saw 4 different specialists. None of them could agree and they kept bouncing me back and forth. None of it was helping. All of it was expensive. And I was spiraling.

Finally, when one of the doctors went on maternity leave, I was transferred to Dr. Iafrate.

In the first appointment, she had identified the underlying problem and scheduled a procedure for a few days later. At the second appointment, she gave me a series of shots that immediately released most of the tens",Female
"What a positive experience! Staff was quick, helpful and so efficient. I waited no time to see Dr. Iafrate. She was knowledgeable, positive, so helpful and THOROUGH and I feel 100% confident that she will solve my shoulder problem. I even want to start seeing her for my achillies tendon issues. I would highly recommend her.",Female
"I will ditto all the positive statements about her.  She leaves no stone unturned in trying to diagnose your problem, and is very caring.  I even sent my son to her who also had a positive experience, and is on the road to recovery.  There is one problem -   it is very difficult to get through to make an appointment, and it takes her quite awhile to respond to emails.",Female
"Highly knowledgeable, personable and possesses deep expertise in sports medicine.

"I've been suffering with plantar fasciitis for almost 2 years. I did steroids injection; physical therapy; ice therapy; massage therapy; sleep in a foot brace and changed my shoes to include proper arch support. Nothing helps. I am a Nurse so I am on my feet a lot and at the end of the day I was in agony. When I wake up in the morning, I could barely step on the floor without excruciating pain.
I met Dr. Julia Iafrate and she knew right away how she could help me.
She performed the TENEX procedure on my left foot and now   I have minimal soreness at the end of my day at the surgical site and today is 6 weeks post op.
The TENEX procedure is done under local anesthesia and took less than one hour. The recovery time is quick. I went back to work in a week wearing a special boot.
Dr. Iafrate is caring; kind and knowledgeable. Now I am back to doing cycling classes and in 4 to 6 more weeks I can dance again. 
If you have plantar fasciitis and nothing works for you, look for Dr. Iafrate.",Female
"Dr. Iafrate and everyone in her office were SO helpful, patient, and highly qualified and knowledgeable. After a week of nightmare appointments all over the city seeing multiple doctors, Dr. Iafrate identified my issue immediately and helped my injury heal quickly. She was SO great about getting back to me about my follow up questions, and helped me find the right follow up treatment provider even with  my tricky insurance situation. The front desk was incredible helpful and patient as well in dealing with a really hard insurance situation. They were able to squeeze me in very last minute. She even printed some info off for me to take home which was so helpful. I went to the ColumbiaDoctors Morningside 601 West 113th Street location and HIGHLY recommend. I will be back for any future issues!!",Female

Wow! What an awesome doctor. Totally recommend for any joint pain especially for athletes. ,Female
"Dr. Iafrate is great with athletes -- understanding their needs and bodies. She took the time to explain possible causes and treatment options for my hip pain, and answered every question I had. I never felt rushed during our appointments, or like my complaints/issues/questions weren't being taken seriously. She stuck with me through a difficult case until we found the route of the issue and were able to treat it effectively. ",Female
"She took the time to explore options and discuss what was the best way to treat my issue, by far the most professional, thorough and understanding Dr I've ever seen.

"Wow. Dr. Iafrate might be my favorite physician. I'm so happy I sought out her expertise for my Achilles tendinopathy. I'm a dancer and cannot ""just rest"". She gets that and has given me treatment options that nobody else ever offered. Go to her! you wont be sorry!",Female
"My daughter had been dealing with a foot issue for over a year.  We had seen numerous Doctors, Physical Therapy, Anit Inflammatory Medication and nothing worked.

"Have used Peter as pur family doctor for many many years. He came into our lives in 1968 when we moved to the south suburbs and our oldest daughter was 6 months old.

We all used his pleasant manor and wonderful follow ups. When he left the south  suburbs to go to Colorado,  we missed him terribly.

"I went to Dr. Iagullis Office a little over a year and a half ago with complaints of neck and left shoulder pain. They INSISTED it was my rotator cuff and got MRIs that saw some bone spurs, arthritis, and that my left bicep wasn't attached. Took a few months before paying roughly 2500$ out of pocket for a surgery when my neck was the problem. I told them I was on a time constraint at the first visit with insurance and wouldn't have it forever. They refused to look at my neck until months after my shoulder surgery where they found I had cervical spinal stenosis. They referred me somewhere else but my insurance had expired by then and I exhausted all my funds getting to a point to where my insurance covered everything and they didn't take my concerns serious. Now I am in an unreal amount of pain, barely able to walk or move my arms, and I have no insurance or money. I am 21 years old, and all because of the lack of them believing my concerns of my neck being the problem.",Male
I am a 73 year old woman and have suffered with pain since I was a youngster for various reasons but in the last couple of years it has intensified due to arthritis and various issues.

I had a procedure with him yesterday at Baylor Trophy and hope that it will help to avoid hip replacement. Highly recommend.,Male

I live in Florida but I travel to Texas to see Dr. Iagulli.  IF and when I must have surgery, I will trust NO other doctor to do it.  He shoots from the hip and doesn't gloss over your pain, but is still conservative in his treatment.  He is superior in every way and I am thankful I found him.",Male
"I think he is technically proficient.  I believe the surgery was as good as could be expected.  Office staff terrible about returning calls in a timely manner, techs (nurses?) not very bright (tried to put my brace on upside down, with narrow part around my thigh) and doctor not very personable, does not seem to listen well.",Male
I was referred by my PCP to Dr. Iagulli due to a sports injury.  I have been pleased with my care and treatment.

I will tell my friends and family about him.,Male
"My daughter is a dancer who sustained a hip labrum tear.  While other doctors recommended surgery, Dr. Iagulli took a more conservative approach and prescribed medicine and physical therapy, which worked wonders!

"I had excellent care while under the care of Dr. Iagulli. My surgery went well and the after care was great too. The only negative comment I have regarding this practice is their is a breakdown in communication somewhere. On three separate occasions I have had issues regarding this.

It took 6 WEEKS after the Dr first prescribed P/T for my sciatica for anyone to contact me.  They ultimately did a procedure, and I couldn't even reach anyone to follow up on it.  I think the doctors are competent and nice, but the entire organization of Othopedic Associates is completely disorganized and a NIGHTMARE.  I finally had to switch mid-treat",Male

"Dr. Iammatteo delivered my second child. Never have I been so appalled by a medical professional's behavior. He acted completely annoyed that he had to come into the hospital to deliver my baby at 2am, and he was skeptical of my desire to have a natural birth. He proceeded to give me an episiotomy without telling me or getting my consent, and when I told him I didn't want one, he literally yelled at me in the delivery room, ""Fine if you want to tear, then tear!"" in front of my husband and the nursing staff. NEVER have I had such a demeaning and disrespectful experience with a doctor -- much less while in the MIDDLE OF GIVING BIRTH. He should be ashamed of himself. DO NOT see this doctor if you want to play even the smallest role in your health care. Unfortunately I will always have this memory when thinking about my daughter's birth.",Male

He not only addressed all of our questions and concerns regarding my pregnancy and the pandemic, he also did so with a true kindness and concern for me and my baby’s well being. His guidance and support during these challenging times put me and  my husband at ease. Thanks to him we now have two beautiful, healthy girls.

His office staff, including his secretaries and nurses, are also wonderful. My husband and I highly recommend Dr. Iammatteo.",Male
"I have lost 4 previous babies before seeing Dr. Immatteo and his team. Once I was 22 weeks with my daughter I was put on 24 hour care at Morristown Hospital and saw him every day no matter how tired he was after days of being there or on call. He delivered many babies right down the hall but switched his tone to accommodate my nerves and severity of my situation. My water broke shortly after 25 weeks and Dr. Greabe preformed and emergency classical incision and we had the best neonatal team working on my baby girl while I was still under. This doctor and team is the most passionate, educated and ‘human’ team you could ask for. My incision is hidden as a normal low c section incision and the high vertical line is on my uterine muscle. I am now 3 months pregnant and he personally takes the time to see me every other week. The only reason drs cannot see emergency patients is because there is a hospital fully prepared for this across the street. miracle baby time and I have an angel dr!",Male
Dr Iammatteo delivered my son in November and I couldn't have been in better hands. I switched to Dr. Iammatteo early on in my pregnancy. I've had great experiences from the beginning.

The staff and nurses always answered my (many) questions in a timely fashion whenever I called. My L&amp;D nurse had great things to say about Dr I as well. ,Male
the office turned away patient with a medical emergency multiple times. closest date to see the doctor which was offered was 3 months away. never heard of a medical office treating patients this way. would not recommend this office to anyone who values their life.,Male

Amy in their office is absolutely amazing, she goes above and beyond to accommodate patients but I wish everyone else had her mentality. ",Male
"I would not recommend. His staff is always kind but he doesn't follow up with his patients. I had a horrible labor and the care I received afterwards was so quick problems arrose. When I called for an emergency appointment, I had to agree with staff to see the doctor. I think he over books and patients don't receive individual care.",Male

GREAT!!!! THE BEST ACTUALLY!!!,Male
"EXCELLENT!!!!!  The best, most professional and knowledgeable. I had total rt hip replacement and I had the best care from Dr Iams.  After having gone through surgery with Dr Iams, I would not choose any other doctor but Dr Iams to have anymore surgeries.  The BEST and good looking also.  He is caring and wants only the best for his patients. His bedside manners are the BEST also. Nothing but 5 stars from me.",Male
"I was so happy to finally get an appointment to see Dr. Iams. What a mistake.  I was praying that he could help me as I am have servere  pain in lower back, groin and leg. He seemed confused as to a diagnosis. He was clearly  biased and his mind was made up when he walked in the room where I was waiting.  He had no empathy for me because I am somewhat overweight.  I became nauseous at his attitude towards me. I left broken, empty. No plan of care. He didn't care period,  glad to be rid of me. ??",Male
"Dr. Iam's is not only a GIFTED surgeon; his bedside manner is superb! He listens, learns, is compassionate, thorough, and calm. I enthusiastically recommend him for any knee replacement! I can't say enough good things about him!",Male
By far my favorite primary care physician I've ever had! She's thorough and has been extremely warm and caring. ,Female
Best PCP I’ve had. She is caring and actually listens to your concerns and partners with you in your healthcare instead of dictating to you a plan of care you may not agree with. Would highly recommend her if you are looking for a new PCP. ,Female
"Wonderful provider. Difficult to schedule initial visit--two-month wait. But, fortunately, the office called back as they had a cancellation and I got the appointment the next day! Dr was really very thorough and listened carefully. So happy to have a great PCP. 
I never find the receptionists at Presbyterian to be friendly. As you move through the office each person becomes nicer. It is a problem at every Presbyterian facility.

The best.,Male
"Dr Iancovici, is a wonderful doctor. He tells it as it is.   Takes time with you ,  he don't rush .  I have been going to him since I was 24 years old , I'm 50.
The only thing  that has to change, when you call to talk to the doctor, they seem to forget to tell him and your waiting all day for a a call back. He is great it's Cambridge  health that has to change .",Male

"Dr. Iancu exhibits a high level of experience, plus an excellent ability at listening and feeding back what I have reported to her.  She has empathy for my physical and personal situation. I feel very valued by her.",Female

"I saw Dr. Iancu for the first time today and was very pleased. She was thorough in her exam, very pleasant and professional, and unlike many doctors these days, took the time to listen. I never felt like my time with her was rushed. I would not hesitate to recommend her to my friends and family.",Female
"I love Dr. Iancu! I was a patient of hers in IL. I was just moving back to the area and was looking forward to being in her care again, unfortunately for me she moved to CO. Which is fortunate for those of you in CO though. Thank you for everything Dr. Iancu. 

P.s. I'm trying to go vegetarian again!

Tiffanie ",Female
"I saw Dr. Iancu for the first time when I switched to Kaiser (and in case you're wondering I hate Kaiser as a healthcare provider). She was in my opinion completely dismissive. She decided that my diet was entirely to blame for my issues and so made no effort to consider alternative possibilities. While I didn't particularly like that approach, it might not have bothered me so much if it weren't for the fact that she then went on to imply my diet was directly correlated to my education level.",Female
"Knowledgeable, Friendly, and Efficient.  Felt like she really cares about her patients",Female
"He was the first doctor to really listen to me and find out the issue of my problems. I had moved from the west coast to Stafford Springs, CT and luckily I did.  He had two offices, so I had to get him while he was in Stafford Springs,",Male
Dr. I is always kind and provides wonderful care.  ,Female
"Dr. ianeeri is kind, patient a great listener, on top of being an excellent OB. She and all the doctors at DWH helped me stick with my delivery plan and when I decided to switch to a c section I didn’t get any judgement and she did such a great job I recovered within a few days. All the doctors were lovely, however she and Dr. Yeh were the two with me during and after delivery and both were wonderful. I heartily recommend them to those in the area.",Female
"Dr. Ianieri is a sweetheart, she’s a very kind and caring doctor.  A few years ago, I had a gynecologic condition, very heavy periods which lead to my becoming severely anemic.  Dr. Ianieri recommended an outpatient procedure with an IUD which has reversed my condition, I am so grateful, I no longer have severe anemia from this condition.  She has been incredibly kind, sweet and performed my procedure successfully.  I have moved away and I miss her!  She is great!!  ",Female
"Doctor Ianieri always makes me feel like I am talking with a friend.  She takes the time to listen and answer questions with effective solutions. She delivered one of my children, via c-section with a huge smile.  Clearly, she loves her work.  She also performed my robotic surgery which allowed me to have a quick recovery. ",Female
I love Dr. Ianieri but it is nearly impossible to get an appointment with her. I always call ahead of time but they are always booked and tell me to call back. It's great the office is expanding but it makes getting an appointment with your doctor nearly impossible. I almost wish she didn't take new patients because for people who have been with the practice for 15 years and used to her it is upsetting that you can't get an appointment with the doctor who has been following you the whole time. I,Female
Dr. Ianieri has provided many years of wonderful care for me. I love that she spends time with me and has a wonderful demeanor and puts you at ease.  The downside is that she keeps taking on new patients and it is next to impossible to get an appointment.... even when I call 4 to 5 months out.,Female
Dr Ianieri explained everything she was going to do and very patiently answered all my concerns. Her pleasant personality is very appealing and encouraged me to discuss any query I had  easily.,Female
Dr. Ianieri is the best doctor ever! She is the most caring and compassionate doctor ever. Her and her colleagues took very good care of me during my pregnancy.  Dr. Ianieri delivered m our baby by c-section and she did such a great job.  I healed so quickly and felt confident that I was in good hands.  The care she provides for her patients is outstanding and I have so much respect for her as a physician.  Truly thankful. ,Female
Dr. Ianieri is beyond amazing at what she does!  Not only did she see me through three pregnancies she delivered all three babies and both myself and my husband are so grateful that she did!  I've never known such a busy doctor to spend so much time and energy on her patients making each one feel taken care of and heard.  She is calm and caring in her approach and has a special way of easing the anxiety that comes along with pregnancy and labor.  I love her!,Female
Caring professional. Provided options for a needed procedure. Followed up by phone the next day. ,Female

Just no! Zero stars if I could ,Female
"We have seen Dr. Iannacone for over 14 years. She is the reason our son is still alive. He has a very rare disorder that she found in our son. I was shocked to see the one-star reviews. Her office staff and the team of doctors, therapist, MDA spokes people and nurse's  Are extraordinary. Every time I see this doctor I hug her neck. She is responsible for saving my son's life. I could never repay her in this lifetime.  she has watched our son grow into the wonderful young man he is today.",Female
"We have been seeing Dr. Iannacccone for a few years. She is direct, but I am fine with that. She provided the info we needed and the required testing.  Startled at the one star reviews. That has not been our experience. ",Female
My first visit with Dr. Iannacone was okay. She was very direct. My second visit with her was great! She took the time to listen and explained what our next steps should be. She is very knowledgeable and we are happy with her.,Female
"Okay with child patient- horrible with parents, decisions, compassion, empathy, courtesy.  Maybe she's better interacting with test tubes than humans.",Female
I can honestly say this was one of our worst Dr experiences ever.,Female
"I had the unpleasant experience of seeing Dr. I on two different occasions. He was rude, unprofessional, arrogant and sexist. He did not listen to me at all and actually cut me off with a wave of his hand. He made me feel like I was crazy and had no valid reason to be there. My N.P. had called him in for his medical opinion. (Follow-up treatment for a vaginal cyst) after examination he actually said, Quote-""If it doesn't bother you, you should just leave it there and use it as a subject to discuss over lunch with your girlfriends."" Then he laughed! Horrifying!
My second run in with him was due to post menopausal bleeding. This time he told me, Quote-""You are too thin to have cervical cancer."" He then went on to rattle off random statistics. Belittling my concerns and health issue, making me feel like I was wasting his time. My ultrasound revealed I needed a biopsy! The office staff also rude and uncaring. They are only concerned that you make payment- UP FRONT!       ",Male
"I just had the privilege of having my baby delivered with Dr.Iannaccone. He made the experience extremely pleasant, and didn’t rush through my labor/delivery which I greatly appreciated. He was a happy guy, and you could really tell he loves his work. I loved seeing how he has a good relationship with the delivery team. All went so smoothly and I would definitely have him deliver my baby all over again!",Male
Terrible bedside manner. Smug and unprofessional.  He immediately started reciting statistics that may happen down the line instead of addressing the matter at hand. I swear he didn't even know my name. He ended out apt only to chase my down in the lobby and have me answer questions that should have been covered under patient confidentiality and not the entire lobby. I am considering leaving the entire practice due to his behavior. Avoid at all costs.,Male
"Dr. Iannaccone rushed through my appointment and made me feel like he wasn’t even listening. I’m 37 weeks pregnant and I had a few concerns but it seems he didn’t care and just came off as arrogant. I sprained my ankle and he “looked” at it with his eyes, didn’t even unwrap the bandage and said I was good even though it is swollen. I will not be seeing him again.",Male
"Horrible. Dr. I was arrogant, dismissive and not a good listener. He was stuck on being right instead of listening to my history. I will never return to him and instead will find another in the practice.",Male
Dr Iannaccone is a fabulous physician.  He is incredibly patcient with his patients.  He takes the time to answer questions and never makes you feel rushed.  He is always on top of labs and test results and always personally calls back to follow up on the results.  Now days he is a rare find in the medical profession.  I have recommended him many times and have never had any of my friends be disappointed.   ,Male
Terrible service. Rude billing department. I called for a simple yearly pap and mammogram appt and for weeks they were calling me telling me my insurance won’t cover the fee. This is not so. I called my insurance company and they said it is covered so I called the doc office and they said they will not call the insurance company and that would be fraud?  Then the billing lady called me and was so rude and impossible to make any sense of her not wanting to call my insurance company. I’ve been goi,Male
"After 2 years of chronic pelvic pain, all I was told by Dr. I was that it was not gynecological and that I needed to see a pain management specialist.  After a recent trip to the ER for this condition, they found cysts, fibroids, and calcification, I believe this IS gynecelogical and I was treated as though I was crazy.  Thank you for prolonging this diagnosis and allowing me to have many months of debilitating pain.",Male

Best nurse and doctors staff you could ask for. Dr I tells you how it is and is very knowledgeable. ,Male
The office made an error and misread my pap test calling me to indicate an abnormality and scheduling me for a further procedure.  When I arrive and met with the doctor he indicated that this was a mistake and there was no abnormality.  This ordeal wasted hours of my time and caused considerable anxiety. I was still charged for the office visit.  The billing department woman was dreadful and unfriendly and the office was not willing to acknowledge their mistake. The $200 was the only priority.,Male

Wonderful doctor. Explained procedure and anatomy extremely well,Female
"I can't speak to Dr. Iannacone's surgical skills as I am still pre-operation. But her other skills appear to be first-rate. She met with me to explain in careful detail AND in everyday English what to expect from the surgery, both before and after. There was no impatience whatever and none of the hauteur and condescension that seem to be a professional hazard among surgeons.

Would give 5 stars if not for the non-proactive front and back office staff (scheduling, reception, and billing) which have not returned phone call requesting appointment, and have incorrectly billed me for services but are working to fix it (after I called twice).",Male
"About two years ago, I was looking for a new primary care physician and my cardiologist recommended Dr. Ianniello. I could not be more happy with that recommendation. When I meet with Dr. Ianniello he listens, always allows adequate time to discuss any health concerns that I may have and perhaps most importantly, I am very confident that he has the experience/knowledge necessary to keep me on a healthy path for years to come (God willing). Last, but not least, he is truly a really nice man.
",Male
"One of the best doctors I’ve ever dealt with. He is kind, caring, attentive, thorough, and always takes his time. He was my husband’s and my primary physician for 4 years and we know we won’t find another doctor quite like him as we are moving out of the country. Definitely 100% recommend!",Male
"Dr. Ianniello is a special Dr. who treats you like you were family. He frequently says, ""if it were me , this is what I'd do"". He always has time to listen to any concerns you might have and gives you several options to consider. Can't think of a more caring person I know...",Male
"Great listener, sharp in early diagnostics, friendly to interact with, interesting person and caring personal physician. Not many out there like Dr. Ianniello!",Male
Wonderful pediatrician,Female
"Dr Iannini is your typical dr who doesn't care about the patient. I saw him yesterday, he didn't even look me in the eyes. I was seen for under 60 seconds by him, before he left. I hardly had a chance to explain my issue. I'll never go back to him.",Male
"I had an appointment with Dr. Iannini yesterday.  I actually thought I was going to see Dr. Smith.   I told Dr. Iannini that I was experiencing very itchy skin on my face and in my ears.  She moved the hair away from my forehead and looked at it.  She never looked in my ears!  We did discuss some medications that I have used in the past.  Then she gave me another Rx to put on my face.  That was it.  Then she said we are going to give you an appointment to have a complete skin check.  That was it.  I don't think she was even with me for 5 minutes.  I really fell as tho I got the bums rush!  I will probably go back for the skin check, being as I have never had one done.  After that, I will probably look for a different dermatologist.",Female
Great doctor.I have a lot of skin cancer and she catches it ALL.  She is very very pleasant and so are the office personnel. I wouldn't go anywhere else.,Female
"Not enough characters to fully explain my situation, but the brief version is I called Fort Mill Dermatology to confirm my Friday appointment and was told I already missed my appointment on Tuesday.  There is no way I made a tues appointment as I always have responsabilites that day.  They refused to reschedule until I paid a no show fee.  I told then they got the appointment wrong and I never received a confirmation call or email and they refused to waive the fee.  Took my business elsewhere.",Female
"First time for dermatologist in SC. Dr. Smith not taking new patients.
Saw Dr. Iannini last Thursday. Took quick with exam and not letting me ask questions. A little patronizing. May have cancerous growth that was removed. Wait one week for results. Don’t have faith in hearing from them. Prescription needed not called in to pharmacy. Decided not to bother. Wait for results and seek another doctor. That’s what I get for finding a doctor on line. Going with another doctor recommended by family.",Female
" The first time I visited this office I was pleased; after my most recent visit in December I will never go here again.   I had an EXTREMELY difficult time getting the staff to send information regarding a prescription to my insurance company for approval. I have never had to argue with a doctor’s office before.  While in the room, the doctor was extremely rude to me, even going so far as to give me instruction on how to handle my own daughter. HORRIBLE BEDSIDE MANNER.   Great nurse, awful dr",Female
"First visit today and LAST!. The front office staff was eating at the front desk and I mean stuffing their faces....When I went to the room it took her an all of 10 minutes to greet me and see why I was there and tell me she can't help me.. I had a tiny mole on my face that I wanted removed.  I knew it was cosmetic I just wanted it gone ..She said she can't do it cause it will leave a scar.  I have had 3 done before with NO problem NO scarring.   As far as her personality, she doesn't have one.",Female
"Dr Ianinni has been my dermatologist for at least 10 years. I have years of sun damage and therefore, have had many basal cell cancers frozen, cauterize so, biopsies and surgically removed. She is thorough and compassionate. She takes time to explain the procedures and listens to my concerns. She and her staff are excellent.",Female
Dr. Iannini is wonderful.  She was warm and friendly and very attentive to me.  She also has the most gentle touch.  My wife was with me at the appointment and she also thinks Dr. Iannini is great.  We would recommend her highly.,Female
Excellent doctor and result.  He performed Bowel obstruction surgery on me on 9-26-20,Male

I will be forever grateful for his expertise!! Thank you !!!",Male
"I would not trust this Dr. With the care of my love one every again. My family father received surgery by him. He was told he was cancer free after the surgery,  he had all his interns coming and and reviewing my father after surgery stating that my father was cancer free. He was not being truthful, I found it not normal that myfather did not need any treatments after his surgery. My father went to the emergency room 30 days later and was diagnosed stage 4 cancer with only weeks to live.",Male

"I was diagnosed with breast cancer just prior to having surgery for gall bladder removal.  Dr. Iannoli was very compassionate and understanding about my illness and totally made me feel comfortable about our first meeting.  He is an excellent surgeon, explained everything to me item by item, and followed up with personal telephone call to me to check on me.  He is one of the best.",Male
"I saw Dr. Iannolli in March of 2018. He was kind at the consult, after that he had the worst bed side manners, very rude, and very unkind. I would NEVER recommend him to anyone!",Male
On August7th 2018 I had a breast lumpectomy performed by Dr. Iannoli.  I was very pleased with the outcome. All the margins were clear as well as the sentinel node which was also removed.  Dr. Iannoli is a very knowledgeable and through surgeon and I would highly recommend him.  If I ever need surgery in the future I would want Dr. Iannoli to perform it.,Male
"Dr. Iannoli recently repaired my wife's  very large paraesophageal hernia. Thanks to his skill as a surgeon, my wife is now doing very well and  the  future quality of her life will be greatly improved . Not only is he a highly skilled surgeon but also a very gentle, caring person in the manner that he addressed our questions and concerns.  I would gladly recommend his services to my family and anyone needing his services! ",Male
"I was so shocked at the treatment my aging mom received from Dr Pasquale Iannoli.  He was so rude, unkind, short and downright mean.  My mom did not deserve that treatment from this Man.  It was so uncomfortable to be in his presence.   We walked out of there saying ""what was that""????? 
I am in hopes that this review is read by many and all women who might see Dr. Iannoli and that this saves them from experiencing his abuse.  It was so demeaning to be spoken to like the way he spoke to us",Male
I had my surgery sept 26 17. And everyone was great Dr Iannoli was great.I would tell everyone to see him.Everyone made me feel very comfortable we laughed it was just great.I had my gallbladder taken out I'm and feel good .SO THANK DR IANNOLI AND ALL NURSES AT THE Hospital. Petra Riley.,Male
Absolutely wonderful. Explained everything prior to surgery and came in on the day of surgery and explained the procedure to my wife and I. Followed up with my wife while I was in recovery. Office wait times are minimal. ,Male
Dr Iannoli saved my life. He treated me &amp; my family with the care &amp; compassion. I've recommended him to all my family &amp; friends. ,Male
Dr. Iannoli and ENTIRE staff are rude and inconsiderate.  My husband has been to may doctors this year and we are only at March. Very disrespectful to not only the patient but the family as well. This entire story will be shared with everyone I know. I wouldn't ask for his help if I was the one on my death bed and he was the last man standing. How do you scorn the wife of a patient about the patient's medical concerns and ask the doctor why him as well as his staff lacked with translating ORDERS,Male
Dr. Iannoli is the single most competent doctor that I have ever seen. He had to break the news that I had cancer to me while I was in the ER one evening...just happened to be luck that he was the on-call surgeon. He has done all of my operations and I trust him completely. People seem to think he comes off as sarcastic and arrogant...but thats just his sense of humor and I get it completely. He has never once offended me...he backs me up 100% in all of my treatment decisions! He is the best!,Male
"Dr Iannolo is a fantastic physician.  She is incredibly caring and diligent.  I was being treated for stress fracture in my femur-I had my initial appointment, x-ray and mri all in the same day which was very convenient.  I'm so grateful she found the cause of my pain so quickly, which allowed me to start treatment and healing.  I can't thank her enough for getting me running again.  I highly recommend her.  
I also wanted to mention that the entire staff at Upstate Bone and Joint was great and accommodating.  The check in people, the x-ray techs and Pam, Dr Iannolo's nurse were just really wonderful to interact with.",Female
Great dr..  taking care of multiple injuries I sustained in a car accident.  Secretary a bit grumpy  but dr great ,Female
"I went to Upstate Orthopedics' walk in hours on a Saturday morning.  My shoulder had been bothering me for some time, and it was time for a professional opinion.   The receptionist, nurse, and rad tech were professional and courteous.   Dr. Iannolo was very professional, courteous, and caring.  She showed sincere interest in my well being, and great knowledge of the cause and care of my issue.  She was very willing to answer all my questions in detail.  I would absolutely recommend her to anyone",Female

This doctor helped me get back on track. Where another doctor from another hospital did not show any patient care and was careless. Dr. Alex Iannone took time to listen to me. He have a great personality and is easy to talk to. I admit I gave him a hard time because of prior bad experience. I'm grateful for him and all he did to help me and my family. Your work is not in vain. We appreciate you Dr. Job well done!,Male
He was very helpful and answered all my questions.,Male
"2015 knee MRI he read this and reported multiple issues within the knee. Bone spurs, loss of joint fluid, meniscus worn down, patella not in the right position (due to previous patellar open fracture) Questioned whether there was a previous patella fracture. Noted that twice.
Jump to 2018 knee MRI. All of those issues seemingly disappeared. Will not go back to this provider.",Male
"Dr. Iannone visited me in the hospital. He was the first doctor I had seen after an emergency procedure the day before. This was Day 2 of a ten day stay. His first words were ""Well I see you are 6 months pregnant"". He then told my wife to ""keep the refrigerator door locked"". He didn't ask if we had questions. He just said those things and then left. We were so puzzled by his arrogance and realize he is older and near the end of his career, but we turned him in and luckily didn't have to see him again!!  If you are looking for a good doctor who cares about the heart health of his patients I would not recommend him at all!!",Male
Dr Iannone is the worst physician that I have ever encountered. He has caused my family so much pain. I ask that he does not come in contact with my family if they are admitted into the hospital. ,Male
This Dr had me and my daughter believing I was on my death bed.  Told me my cholesterol was very high but come to find out he didn't even run a test to check my cholesterol.  Told me my veins and artories looked like a mouse has been chewing them.  Had a angiogram done and found nothing was wrong. ,Male
Explains things very well. Takes his time with patients.,Male
Good doctor ,Male
"He is a very caring Dr. Listens to you never in a hurry. He did by back surgery. I was told if I did not have surgery A.S.A.P...I would end up in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. I now can do anything again, run, walk, golf, swim, ski and etc. He is a fantastic surgeon and loves his job.",Male
Dr. Iannotti is a very friendly and caring doctor. Prior to surgery dr. Iannotti  explained what my problem was and what he would have to do to repair the problem. After surgery he explained what the procedure was. All of his office staff is kind and friendly.,Male
"I scheduled an appointment with this Doctor and let the staff know several days prior that I have a medical condition that does not allow me to wear a mask. (This is in my medical records from several Doctors that I have previously seen and have been able to continue to get care, tests, exams and 3 recent MRI's without wearing a mask). I was informed that if this was an issue that they would be in contact with me the week prior to the visit. Not only did I hear nothing back but the appt was confirmed 3 times before the date. The day before the appt the office called to reconfirm my appt and at that time I was told that if I wasn't wearing a mask I was not allowed in the building. They did not ask or care as to why I couldn't wear one they just said no. My insurance had already booked a room for me since I had to travel some distance and cannot drive far because of extreme pain. I thought part of the Oath Dr's take is to ""First Do NO harm"". I guess it doesn't apply to this group of Dr's",Male
"I went to Dr. Iannotti because my sciatica pain had gotten so bad I could not walk without the aid of a walker.  The leg pain was unbearable!
Dr. Iannotti performed a spinal surgical procedure that was short of a miracle.

"Dr. Iannotti is a kind, compassionate surgeon.  When I initially met him, he explained my MRI thoroughly and the urgency for my surgery in terms I could understand.  He takes the time to address all your questions and has a great personality. He made me feel confident in his expertise.  My surgery on L4-L5 disc took place on March 31, 2019.  My recovery was exactly as he had explained. He has a great rapport with the staff at Banner University Medical Center and the staff caring for me spoke highly of him.  I am pleased to have found such an excellent surgeon and highly recommend him.

This is one amazing Neurosurgeons! He was very candid with me about the surgery I needed. My spinal surgery of the C4-5 and C5-6 disc took place on 8/1/2018. On 8/2/2018 I was up walking around. Two weeks after surgery I was able to take off my neck brace. What an amazing and caring Doctor! He cares about his patients and I would recommend Dr. Iannotti to anyone needing spinal surgery.

Dr. Iannotti is a compassionate, kind, friendly, easy to talk to Dr.  He does not operate when it is unnecessary.  He explains things well and in terms the average person can understand.

Dr I’s office is the problem here. Saw him 1x. He was ok. His office staff sucks! They accused us of lying. Hung up on me twice. Takes forever to get someone on the phone. They’re always at lunch (brought in 3x - we saw this). Even the va couldn’t get them on the phone! Just bad business. Don’t need them operating me.,Male
"Dr. Iannotti performed surgery on my father and was successful in removing the tumor on his brain.  However, this man has zero bedside manner.  He is very arrogant and doesn't have the time to talk to the patient or the family.  He is very good at making you feel that you are not smart enough to have a conversation with him.  His office staff is just as bad; unhelpful.  If you have a choice, I/we recommend you find a different neurosurgeon unless you like being degraded!",Male
"  When I went to see Dr. Iannotti I was getting around using a wheel chair and a walker. This was during my initial consultation. I was refered by my physician for having lower back pain and leg weakness. After reviewing my MRI, DR. Iannotti told me of my condition and explained what needed to be done to correct that condition.  He gave me options and I elected to have an operation that he preformed several times. This made me feel at ease to have the operation done. Excellent surgeon.",Male
"Tried to get an appointment. Was told first they need past medical records.  Next, was told I needed a referral got that. Referral said self-pay told them I wasn't, they wouldn't call to confirm benefits, made me get insur co send fax. Finally, they said dr would review my file.  Called and was told because I had previous surgery within a certain amt of time they wouldn't see me. wasted 6weeks, in pain, could have asked that questions on first phone call. Rude and uncaring staff.",Male
Dr Iannotti gave me back some of my independence. He did not label me as a non-responder because i did not respond to procedure like control group. Followed his own protocol which led me to being qualified for a stint After a bad experience with Kaiser Duluth i did not know if I could trust doctors again.  He has an awesome soul and is so  humble both of which are priceless. Im so glad that I took a chance on him. In time I'm looking forward to regaining as much of my independence as possible.,Male
"Educates patients on disease/conditions needing surgery. Takes the time as needed to ensure understanding. Performed two spine surgeries and I recovered as expected.

Dr. Iannotti had my wife tested with PET scans to stage and treat her cancer.  We  were told she was disease free.  When she began experiencing symptoms less than a month later he scheduled her for another PET scan.  Before she could make the appointment I had to take her to the emergency room.  A  second opinion at Shands medical center told us that the cancer had spread and was inoperable.  She died four months later.  If she had received proper treatment I believe she would still be alive  ,Male

Dr.Jafar is an amazing woman. If you are struggling with addiction I swear she has saved my life!! I walked in her office desperate for help to change my life and I walked in the right door.

"This doctor is the last person who would ""push medications on people"" as the reviewer below has stated. I know from personal experience and from talking with other patients that she frequently makes an effort to try and encourage patients to reduce their medications that have potential side effects. Dr. Jafar is kind and patient and takes the time to listen to concerns and work together with her patient allowing them to have a say in their treatment which is rare these days. Highly Recommended ",Female
"The comment below is very uncalled for. Drs are humans too and therefor have families who need them. She had a family emergency and had to go to India. And as for pushing medications? If anything she has helped me get off of medication. She has always been kind, takes her time, and listens. I would highly recommend her to anyone. ",Female
"If you want a doctor that pushes medications onto people, doesn't truly listen to what the patient is saying, and that gets up and leaving to India for over a month without notice leaving all of her patients who are dependent on her care without concern then yeah Dr.Jafar is the one for you.

"I became a patient less than a year ago and was relieved to have found the perfect doctor from the very first visit.  Dr. Jafar provides old-fashioned personal care with new-fashioned expertise, rare in today's medical environment.  She is very intelligent, a very good doctor, and a very nice person.  Her office manager and assistant complement Dr. Jafar perfectly, combining efficiency with grace and humanity.  One could not ask for a better experience.

",Female
"I recommend everyone that I know to Dr. Jafar, and that obviously includes my family. I have known her for the better part of a decade. The doctor graduated at the top of her medical class here, in the United States. You may wait 10 mins in the waiting room, but she will spend an hour with you, if it's what you require. She is very observant and hardly ever lets anything slip by her unnoticed. In the event of an emergency, there is a MLSS Ambulance Station 1min away, located on the same road.",Female
I would not recommend Dr. Jamieson.  I did not agree with his business practices and did not feel that he cared about me as a patient.,Male
"I saw Dr. Jamieson for over a year and have found a new doctor due to his unkind and rude staff. They were not helpful, never called back when I had questions and were so rude it made me feel very uncomfortable. Dr. Jamieson will continue to lose patients if he does not work to find a staff that listens, respects and is kind to patients.",Male
I have been seeing Dr. Jamieson for a little less than 10 years and have always had a pleasant and affirming experience both with him and his staff. Very caring and thoughtful in their patient care and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a new OB/GYN.,Male
"Been a patient for over three decades and can't imagine going to any other Doctor. The ease of scheduling appts., the time he takes to answer any questions, the caring staff, and the comfortable atmosphere all are treasures. Not to mention, the skill level. If you are looking for a great Doctor, look no further...",Male
"I went to Dr. Jamieson for my irregular bleeding and weight gain. He spent time listening to my concerns and after extensive testing, determined I had polycystic ovarian syndrome. With his help and treatment I'm finally back to normal. I always recommend Dr. Jamieson to my friends and family!",Male
"Dr Jamieson has been extremely helpful for me, providing excellent care and advice. My quality of life significantly improved under his care. I am very thankful.",Male
"I went to Dr. Jamieson because of my irregular periods, acne and weight gain. He diagnosed me with P.C.O.S. Now with a treatment regiment my acne is a lot better and I've lost weight. I'm very thankful for Dr. Jamieson and his help. I highly recommend Dr. Jamieson. ",Male
I like Dr Jamieson I have been with him for many years.  I trust him and he talks to you and explains everything he is doing and why and any medications he gives you.  He makes you feel relaxed and in good hands during your visit,Male

I love Dr jaacks she's amazing at everything she does and always the best listening ear and she is the best doctor I've ever had ,Female
"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! I had my first visit with Dr. Jaacks. She's rude, unprofessional, aggressive, has no bedside manner and needs sensitivity training. She was asking me questions about my miscarriage and then cut me off while answering and said what I had told her about what happened couldn't be true, basically calling me a liar. She only has 11 years experience and is NOT a high risk dr. My last OB who tested my placenta after the last miscarriage had 40+ years exp and was a high risk dr but sh",Female
"Love Dr. Jaccks she took care of me made, me feel comfortable, super nice answered all my questions and was just truly amazing! Throughout my whole pregnancy back in 2015!!",Female
He is friendly and explains procedures.  He also tries to limit your out of pocket expenses.,Male
"I took my 12 year old daughter for the first time to Dr Jaafar for her annually check up. Dr. Jaafar sat with us before staring the check up and we spoke for about 20'-30' about health history. Dr. Jaafar was very carrying, a great listener and great at explaining different health related topics. My daughter is a healthy 12 year old just going through puberty it was helpfull to have Dr Jafaan answering her questions. Excellent doctor I wished we would had her with us since my daughter first year",Female
Dr Jaafar was very professional and personable.  I had a colonoscopy and will continue using his Gastro services and would highly recommend him to family and friends.,Male
"By far one of the best doctors I have ever been to. Very knowledgeable, investigative, willing to listen, communicative, and truly cares about the well-being of his patients.",Male
"He is amazing with Chase. Truly care an dies complete check ups.  He is on point with referrals. Thank you Jaafar.
",Male
"I wish I read these reviews before visiting her. She was horrible! Her phone kept dinging and of course she kept responding. She called one of the women in her front office a 'diet freak'. Told me that my co-pay was $75 more because of services rendered. Mind you, this was my first visit. When I asked her 'What other services?' then explained that this was a consultation only,  she said 'Oh, is that how it works?' Also, every procedure I asked about she quoted the cost before anything. She is money hungry! She did not exam me but was quick to take out a prescription pad and offer medication. What an embarrassment to the medical profession. I feel sorry for the patients who are clueless and accept her flimsy explanation because she's a doctor.",Female
"I've been going to Dr. Jaafar for three years
 I find her very knowledgeable and caring Dr.",Female
"he is absolutely the worst doctor I have ever dealt with!! .Does not care for her patients. Only how many she can fit in a day. Always arrives one hour late. Sometimes even longer. Patients wait in her office for hours. She is offensive, sarcastic, and disrespectful to her patients. No help to her patients. She is a passive aggressive person who feeds on her own vile. Good luck trying to call her office, never returns calls and her aides are worthless. On one appointment, as i am waiting for her to show up, I actually witnessed a patient crying in her office and made her wait over an hour for help. If I can give her a zero star I would. Please look for someone else for your pain!!!!",Female
"I saw Dr. Jafaar at 1250 waters pl. for the first and last time. She is offensively sarcastic which is disrespectful to her patients.  She told me my sciatica isn't chronic if I haven't had surgery or injections despite it already being diagnosed as chronic pain. Then said my pain isn't severe without even asking me any details about my pain the whole visit only what meds I was on.  Also when I told her I didn't want to get surgery or injections yet, then she said I must not be having real pain!",Female
I have never experienced such horrible bedside manner in my entire life. After my last experience I changed dcotors. She literally got angry with me because SHE was behind schedule and once I got in there she asked me what I wanted her to do?r I refuse to ever return to her. BEWARE and read all the reviews before you bother seeing her because they are all true. The good reviews are totally fake otherwise they woukd be more specific with their reviews.,Female
She has a horrible bedside manner. You wait over an hour to see her for just a few minutes... just for her to ask you want you her to do. Isn’t she the doctor? The time spent in the room is not as much of the problem if it spent helping the patient. I should have read the other online reviews before going to her. Do not make the same mistake.,Female
"I was not impressed at all! Walked into the office and was greeted immediately with ""Your copay is $50"" not even a hello. Waited almost 45 mins past appt in a wheelchair until we finally complained because of my pain level while sitting. Most of the visit was spent with her typing with minimal eye contact. She asked me questions for information I had already provided a minute before due to her lack of paying attention. New patients: LOOK ELSEWHERE AND SAVE YOUR TIME.",Female
"Very in depth doctor and very knowledgeable when it comes to medications, she will help you and at the same time will look after your best interests. She spent 20 minutes answering all my concerns and questions, very friendly and cracks jokes, recomended!",Female
"Great physician, smart and straight to the health point",Male
"I’ve been a Patient of Dr.Jaafar’s for 20years ,back in the days of the little building in Bandera. I have been impressed by the growth and the experienced Physician’s he has taken on to improve his patient’s health. Fortunately and unfortunately Ive used Dr Jaafar’s hospice services for loved ones. I was more than impressed and totally satisfied with everything. 
  I had a situation last year where I had a severe bone infection and almost lost a finger. Had it not been for Dr. Jaafar &amp;Dr Alder I would have lost a finger and possibly even my entire hand. Dr Jaafar on his own time called multiple hand specialists trying to find Someone who could see me immediately.
I have seen Dr Alder for the past few years and I am just as impressed by his knowledge and compassion. He never rushes and he listens intently.
As for the secretary, the insurance specialist, the appointment taker, all of the front desk personnel they have always been Texas Friendly!
Thank you Kindly for all you do!!",Male

"I love Dr. Jaafar and I too have experienced difficulty with his staff at times.  I once brought this to his attention, told him I love him but because of his front office staff I would considering changing doctors.  He said he would take care of it, I think it has gotten a little better.  But who ever runs that area needs to stay on top of this.  This makes a big difference in patient care.  Recently, I was prescribed some meds which were called in to Walgreens.  I picked them up, later got an order from Humana for the same meds??? Appears two different people ordered the meds, one from Walgreens and one from Humana.  I had to return the meds from Humana.  But this is what I'm talking about.  Come on, get with it.......something needs to be done to lay the law down with this staff.",Male
"Dr Jaafar himself is an excellent dr as are most of his other doctors and PA's. However in the 11 years that I have been going there, there have been a few that weren't so good, and in fact were poor. Thankfully they do not last long. The big problem with the Bandera office is, and always has been the front office staff. They are unfriendly and obstructive at times to patients seeking much needed care for serious problems and I am not speaking of colds and flu. Love Dr. Jaafar but he really needs to do something about the front office staff. They have driven myself and other residents to seek care from other medical professionals over the years.",Male
Thank you so much for taking such great care of my ailing father. Our community is blessed to have such a  wonderful doctor and staff.  The advise to send my father to a rehab hospital was above and beyond and I am forever grateful.,Male
"Superior staff, superior doctor, surperior treatment. 
Thank you Bandera Family Practice!",Male
"Office staff are more interested in themselves than the people who they are paid to assist. Another Dr. was seeing my wife and ordered a stat blood draw. They had closed down the office to get to their hot cars. Then SHE, and she knows who She is, said we could drive to another location. I find this inhospitable and makes all the Dr.s and nurses look bad. My name is John A. and I am not hiding.",Male
Dr.Jaafar is GREAT but his front office staff especially Ms. LISA is a royal pain in the but (I am putting this politely) the staff doesn't do their job and OMG if you complain about it they put all the blame on you. Have had multiple issues with Ms.Lisa over the last 10 years ..personally I think she needs to be fired !!!!!,Male
"Like always, excellent ",Male
"Nurses and front desk care more about lunch hour than a chest pain patient. Poor patent evaluation skills. OSHA would have a field  day. Doctors had not left for lunch yet, but nurse and front desk wouldn’t let us been seen even though it was still 10min before lunch. Poorly educated nurse. Had to tell them that it was chest pain while they were turning us away. The desk had a nurse come out to check respirations and pulse, and tell us to come back for appt later.",Male

My family and I have been under the care of Dr. Jaafar for 20 yrs. Dr. Jaafar is very through and diligent in his patient care. He has the best Doctor's that work with him for complete family care. The Bandera office staff are very friendly and competent. His P.A.'s are excellent as well.,Male
"I see Dr. Jaafar and his staff at the Stone Oak office.  I am a very satisfied patient of this office.  It is well run, very professional, and run like I feel your physician's office should be.  Very caring, patient, and will do anything to help the patient.  Dr. Jaafar is outstanding as your primary physician.  He is thorough, explains issues in a very understandable manner, and has an excellent bedside manner.  I always leave with a feeling that I am so grateful to have these folks on my team.",Male
Fantastic doctor but the office staff is about as unorganized and and worthless as they come. ,Male
We absolutely LOVE this amazing doctor and his staff. Dr. Jaafar has extraordinary skills and patient care! We go to Dr. Jaafar's Bandera and Stone Oak clinics and adore the staff. They are so friendly and accommodating every time we are there!   I agree that it is  sad to see people hide behind the internet and post rude comments.  Give this fine doctor and his staff a chance to reach out to you and solve your problem.   Please stop the small town mentality of gossip and negativity here.,Male
"He sees 4 generations of our family! We all are very pleased and have always felt like it was his honor to be our doctor! We have been walk in as well as appointment patients. We will not leave his care.  As a matter of fact, let me publically thank him for all he has done for our family!

Dr Jafaar is great but I think he has spread himself too thin between clinics as the quality of care and respect for patients care has declined. I have been a patient  with his practice in Castroville for more than 15 years but am looking for a new doctor due to the incompetence of his office staff.,Male
"Dr Jafar and his Stone Oak clinic is horrible.  They over charge you, they give you a, I don't care attitude, they say they will call you back and they do not. I have been overcharged for too long. They sent a urine test off and charged me $4,500.00 Yes that is right $4,500.00 from a hospital that tested it in Texas. Then my wife had the same test and they charged her $1,900.00 for the report both billed to my insurance. The office manager is horrible and has no care attitude about anything.",Male
Dr. Jaafar is a wonderful doctor but the office personnel are very incompetent. They talk bad about you in front of your face and they are never willing to help you. I tied getting my prescription renewed for over a week and all they would tell me is that they couldn't promise anything. Dr. Jaafar either needs to shut down the office in Castroville or get new office personnel. I am finding a new doctor and will never go back to him again.,Male
Listened to me and paid very close attention to test results. Gave me the information I needed and answered my questions thoroughly!,Male

He is nice and friendly.  Service with a smile.,Male
Dr. Jaakkola operated on my foot from a fall five years ago.  The surgery was a success.  A couple months ago I felt like I was walking on a tack and went for him to look at my foot again.  He fixed me right up!  It was just something simple but he never made me feel like I was wasting his time.  He is an awesome doctor and I highly recommend him.,Male
"I had my achilles’ heel done by Dr Jaakkola, on 10/2019. His bedside manner was excellent and my recovery time going back and forth to his office was excellent.

Dr. Jakkola is a Senior ortho physician at Optim who excels in providing the best treatment to his patients. Too bad you can only give 5 Stars he deserves more.,Male
"Dr. Jaakkola is a most competent orthopedic. Not only was he very thorough in his diagnosis; he also gave three steroid shorts in joints of my toes with an absolute minimum of discomfort. Friends of mine advised against the injections because the were to to cause excruciating pain. Not true,!
I walked in on crutches and the next day I walked without pain.
Also,Dr Jakkoola is a very pleasant human being who put you at ease and takes all the time it needs to inform you and to advise you on shoes, and supper for my flattening foot

I warmly recommend Dr Yakkoola",Male
Dr. Jaakkola is extremely personable and thorough in his exam. The assistants are knowledgeable and pleasant as well. I was pleased to have good results from an unavoidable complicated surgical treatment. ,Male
Dr. J provided me with detailed explanation about each of the areas of my foot and ankle. He included cause and effect along with drawing a road map on my foot and ankle literally. We discussed options/remedies including shoes/insole supports and wether surgery might be beneficial or not. ,Male

I have had two experiences with Dr J. Both have been excellent. He did surgery on my foot in 2012 and I have had absolutely no problem with it!! Great doctor!,Male

I have dealt with him on and off for years, and every time is the same.  I wish he could be my GP.  I never have trouble getting in to see him, and he is a busy guy.

"I had the best experience with Dr Jabaji... I was experiencing residual pain from a previous surgery not performed by him. And he assured me that he would not only take care of the reason why he was going in there but also investigate why it was having the residual pain. Came out of the surgery fine, the residual pain did not come back. 
I just wanted to hug him for taking the pain that I was having and the residual pain away that I had been experiencing for 5 years. Something that all the other doctors told me it was in my head. And he is the first doctor that actually hugged back.
I refer him to everybody and anybody. This is the doctor to have your back.",Male
"Dr. Jabaji is incredibly smart as well as a great diagnostician, and all the important things you want in a great surgeon. But I'm writing this because he cares unlike any doctor I've ever experienced. Out of literally hundreds of doctors I'd seen, he was unique. Firstly, he told me he could do surgery, but thought another surgeon would a better fit for my highly unique situation. He wanted the best possible outcome for me even if that meant someone else. One day when I was in the darkest of places in severe unrelenting pain and no sleep we passed at the hospital and he remembered me and stopped to see how I was doing. I'm sure he had patients to see, and things to do, but those few minutes reminded me that I had people and doctors behind me that truly cared. Then when I had surgery, he even scrubbed just to be there. Seriously, who else does that!",Male
"Awesome experience. He takes his time answering all questions and concerns, as well as ensuring everything goes smoothly from beginning to end. I am glad I went with Dr. Jabaji to remove my Gallbladder. ",Male

amazing physician!,Male
"I wanted to see Dr. Jabaly so I changed my PCP. Unfortunately I missed the first visit. I realized that I missed the appointment and tried to reschedule. I was told that Dr. Jabaly has a ""policy"" to ban someone from the practice if they no show the first visit. I have worked in medicine for 20 years and never heard of a physician having such a policy. I offered to pay a fee and promised to never miss another appointment. Didn't matter to Dr. Jablaly's ""office manager"" FYI!!!",Male
Dr. Jabaly has been my doctor for over ten years. I cant imagine ever seeing another physician. He’s at the top of his field and is very proactive about your overall physical and mental health.

"Dr. Jabaly was my Mother's Doctor for more than 10 years. He has been my Doctor for over 6 years. My sister came to Dr. Jabaly for over three years.
He explains stuff to you, he spends more time with you than other Doctor's do.  Also, when I need an appointment I can get one pretty quickly. Other Doctor's You have to wait 2 or 3 weeks.  Dr. Jabaly is a Christian man.",Male
Dr. Jabaly is knowledgeable in many areas.   He is simply the best.  He is very friendly and knows exactly what to do for me.  He works between holistic and modern medicine. He is not always ready to prescribe a pill to fix what is going on with me.  He listens and ask questions to understand what my needs are. Dr. Jabaly  explains the lab results to me and not just say they were normal or they are not good.  He is humble and a great man of God of Heaven and a great doctor.  Thank you Dr. Jabaly,Male
"Worst physician experience I've ever had! Dismissed me upon only my 2nd visit for no apparent reason other than I respectfully challenged a couple of his opinions. I was still willing to work with him but he simply refused, tossed me out, and basically escorted me out of the bldg like some kind of criminal. Never in my 30 yrs have I ever been treated so disprespectfully. He's rude, egotistical, has no bedside manner, and is completely unsympathetic/unethical. It's his way or no way. STAY AWAY!!",Male
Dr. Jabaly and his staff has done nothing but support me in my recovery! Most Dr. would have thrown me out so his encouragement has helped me have the strength to go on and want to do better! Those who complain about waiting should remember that he will also take the time for you that he is giving to others if you need it! I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about bettering their life!,Male
"Absolutely an amazing doctor. He is friendly, professional, caring and extremely knowledgable in his fields. It seems most doctors are in it for the money now but Dr. Jabaly is not, when I had no insurance he worked with me to make sure I could afford treatment and now that I'm finally insured he and his staff have all been so helpful making sure everything is taken care of. His staff members are all incredible, the ladies are all so helpful and thorough.",Male
"Dr. Jabaly and his staff goes the extra mile for thier patients. I had several medical issues(that other physicians overlooked), Dr. Jabaly was able to diagnose and help rectify my problems.

the staff who i spoke with on the phone who proceeded to tell me i missed too many appts which i have missed 0 was rude. then she changed it to i canceled too many appts .. well my work schedule changes due to a promotion and had no choice to reschedule after they had called to me to cancel prior to knowing i had the job change to cancel the one i had taken the day off for. never again . horrible,Male
"Had nothing but great experiences with Dr. Jabamoni. She has helped my husband and me conceive our children. Recently, I went to my OB for issues that he wanted to treat with medicine. When it didn’t work, he offered invasive procedures. I went to Dr Jabamoni for a 2nd opinion. She did thorough testing to get to the cause of the problem. It turned out I had tumors causing my issues that she promptly removed, and solved my problems. I would definitely recommend!",Female
Dr. Jabamoni is not promising healh expert. She is offering multiple treatment s without telling outcomes and may change her stand when outcomes are not in favor of patient. She is just worry about applying treatment regardless of patient health condition. Her staff is also not supportive. We have done infertility treatment and at one stage she was not able to find whether I am pregnant or not and she gave medication to get period...so horrible...so inexperienced....so incompetent...very bad,Female
"I previously received outstanding care from a doctor and hospital down-state but re-located and needed to find someone new.  Sitting at her desk felt a bit like I was being interrogated and then having my previous diagnosis dismissed (despite having labs, imaging, results, etc with me).  She contradicted herself as I brought this up and also chose to not treat multiple elevated lab values, without any input from me on how I wanted to proceed.  She's an intelligent doctor, but I may switch. ",Female
"Never had a bad experience here, she helped us conceive our twins and was very supportive during a previous miscarriage. Everyone in the office was very helpful and all my questions were always answered ",Female
"The practice just runs for money. Being a patient of Dr.Jabamoni I was switched to another new doctor within the same practice, without any prior notifications. She even had a nurse perform a procedure which is usually performed by a doctor. ",Female
"Wants to genetic test the beep out of you, your husband and your fetus. Extremely pushy. Will not prescribe medication of any kind for nausea, heartburn, migraines, etc.",Female
"Excellent Doctor.  Spends time with patient. Calls back, follows through. Knowledgeable. ",Male
"I highly recommend Dr. Jabara. He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, patient and compassionate.  He understands your specific needs and approach to disease and works with it.  He doesn't over-prescribe but at the same time he is extraordinarily thorough.  He is interested in the whole patient and not just concerned with renal function.  He is by far the best doctor I have ever had.",Male
"So far so good.  I've only see him twice so far, but Dr. Jabarra listens, explains things well, and seems to apply common sense in his approach.  I notice that several of the negative reviews refer to the staff rather than the doctor himself, but while I'm new to Dr. Jabarra, I've been with a doctor in the practice for a decade or so and have had good experiences throughout.",Male
"Dr. Jabara is a great doctor.  He listens to your feedback and questions, providing you the appropriate responses in return.  The staff in the office are great and greet you nicely as you walk in.",Male
"Dr. Jabara cancelled our appointment last minute because we are hesitant about going through with a medical procedure not without serious potential risks. Yes, a doctor should have the right to choose whether or not they would like to meet with a patient, just as patient has the right to do the same. However, is this ethical? I am disappointed that doctors have seemingly learned to disregard patients' concerns/experiences in favor of an outdated, damaging, one-size-fits-all model of care.",Male
Dr Jabara is a horrible doctor with bedside manor and communication with patients. The office staff is rude and I would not recommend them at all. I have had to call 9 times to try to get any answers and I have never experienced this kind of treatment from any other doctor.,Male
Dr. Jabara has a great bedside manner. He never makes me feel rushed or stupid. He always takes  time to answer my questions and concerns. ,Male
"I will t be coming back to this office.  The first time I went, I ended up getting way over charged for what was supposed to be preventive care.   Today the front desk lady, Amanda, kept giggling about the meds I was wanting to see Dr. Jabara for.  The Doctor said he would call CVS with the prescription and after 6 hours and 2 calls, no prescription.  They always ""promise"" a call back up never do.",Male
I always receive excellent care when seen by Dr. Jarara.,Male

Dr. Jabara fully explained my procedure and the possible outcomes. He put me at ease. I highly recommend him and his staff for their high standards of care.,Male
"The staff was very friendly and good at their jobs, and always made sure I was comfortable.",Male
Took care of my daughter’s broken bones on two different occasions and my son’s knee.  He’s the kindest most patient doctor and has a way of making the kids feel at ease.,Male
Dr. Jabara is wonderful.   My knee replacement surgery was done by a great professional.   My scar is barely noticeable.  I couldn’t be happier.,Male
Dr. Jabara did my knee replacement and always is professional but personal as well.  I would always recommend him to others.,Male

Total knee replacement. Excellent care.  Took the time to explain everything fully. Great bedside manner. Highly recommend. Staff at Blodgett was also excellent.,Male
"Dr. Jabara is a fantastic orthopedic surgeon and a great guy. He replaced my knee a little over a year ago, and I have never felt better. He is kind, compassionate, and takes his time to listen to you and explain what is going on. I have recommended him to many family and friends who have knee issues, and I will continue to do so.  He's the best.",Male
Currently working with Dr. Jabara on our fertility journey and I am very happy so far!  Dr. Jabara has been so helpful and informative. He has tried to cut our costs wherever possible and given us some hope that we didn't have before. I definitely recommend him to anyone struggling with fertility as he will explore all options with you to give you the best chance of conceiving!,Male
"I have been Dr. Jabara's patient for about 6 years.  Through fertility testing, major surgery with complications, two IVF cycles and more, I have always felt that I was in good hands with him.  He's a genuinely nice person who always made me feel that he cared about me and my dream of being a mother.  Not only does he have the medical expertise and skill, but he also has heart.  I have been treated by 20+ doctors in various capacities on my fertility journey, and Dr. Jabara stands out for having real compassion.  I can't tell you how important that is for this process.  We fertility patients are so very vulnerable, and many doctors don't fully understand or adjust their approach to be sensitive about that.  Dr. Jabara is not one of them.  He cares and it shows.  Looking now at my sweet baby girl, I can say that the journey was tremendously challenging in ways I never imagined, but Dr. Jabara remained on my side - a true advocate who goes above and beyond - the entire time.",Male
"We had been trying to conceive for a couple years when we came to Dr Jabara. He was helpful, informative and kind and got us through a challenging time. In the end he helped us to conceive twins!",Male
I was originally referred by a friend who worked at Kaiser that Dr. Sami Jabara was the doctor to go to if you wanted to conceive. Dr. Jabara has such a kind demeanor and you can tell that he truly cares for his patients. Thanks to Dr. Jabara we are now 10 weeks pregnant with our first child. Words cannot express how grateful I am to Dr. Jabara for everything he has done for my husband and I. I would definitely recommend him to anyone going thru the heartbreaking issue of infertility.,Male
Terrible experience..not recommended Dr.Jabara to anyone who has hope &amp; dream of becoming a parent one day .,Male
"Dr Jabara is the best doctor I have ever had. He is warm, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. He always answered my questions quickly. He really care about his patients. When I was very sad for my test results, he was there for me. He explained all the options I had, and guided me throughout the process. He went above and beyond to help me. I feel so lucky to have him as my doctor. Now, I have a cute son because of his help. He made my dream came true.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Jabara",Male
Great experience . Miracle work . Had very low test results on my ovaries and yet was able to help me out . Thank God for having been referred to him.,Male
"We conceived our amazing daughter with the support and guidance of Dr Jabara for an IVF cycle. His passion and energy are infectious and now after having gone to other fertility doctors I truly understand how important it is to be talked to like an individual rather than treated as one of a number of dozens or hundreds, etc. He has a wonderful sense of humor and I would recommend him to anyone interested in pursuing fertility treatments.",Male
"Dr.Jabara was amazing from our first appointment to our last. He is so knowledgeable and caring. I'm not going to lie, when we went to our first appointment we felt nervous and a little scare. But walked out feeling like we couldn't have gotten a better doctor. I had to have a serious of test and procedure but Dr.jabara always made sure to calm me down. Have I mentioned he's beyond amazing! He was there to answer all of our questions and concerns. We got pregnant and were beyond thankful to him!",Male
"Dr. Jabara is by far the best dr I have ever had. Excellent bedside manners. I trusted him 100% during my treatment. He is friendly, knowledgeable, compassionate, dedicated listened to my questions and addressed all my concerns. I am 42 y/o, 8 weeks pregnant (first IVF try). I had to move to a standard OB/GYN and I already miss dr. Jabara. He is truly the best. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",Male
I cannot begin to express how wonderful every person at Dr. Jabara's office was.  We tried for a baby for about two years and a half with the outcomes during that time being a miscarriage and a D&amp;C.  We finally decided to go to Dr. Jabara and I am so happy we did.  ,Male
"Wonderful doctor, he is caring and hardworking- I couldn't have put my family's future in better hands. He is positive and full of good energy, which is reassuring in our difficult situation. We came up on recommendation from a work colleague and will surely recommend him to friends as well. ",Male
"Dr. Jabara treated my sister for infertility and is now treating me, he is the best. I have two wonderful nephews thanks to his amazing ability. After following my sister's recommendation, I also came to see him with help conceiving. He is caring and professional, his staff is wonderful as well. ",Male
"You?re not only! 
The first day I met Dr. Jabara, he took the time to start from the beginning and explain step by step how he was going to help us. I remember leaving his office and feeling hope again. His passion and attention to detail gave me the faith I needed, that soon enough I would become pregnant and start a family with my husband. There isn?t enough words that can describe how much of a blessing Dr. Jabara is to my family. I highly recommend Dr. Jabara to all my family and friends. ",Male
"Dr. Jabara is one of the most caring, patient, and knowledgeable physicians I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He was delicate in the delivery of my diagnosis. He remained optimistic regarding my potential future pregnancies. It finally happened, I'm pregnant!! I owe the start of my beautiful family to Dr. Jabara and his wonderful skilled nursing staff.I would recommend him to anyone desiring a pregnancy. A+++",Male
"My experience was so bad with Dr. Jabara . He was the first and only reproductive specialist that I saw and he immediately decided that IVF was the only way that he would be willing to help me with . He was primarily interested in achieving his own goals rather than mine. I'm writing  this review in hopes of preventing others from having the same sort of experience I did.
",Male
"I had a very bad experience with Dr. Jabara. It was almost impossible to schedule an appointment. My experience in the clinic wasn't even the greatest, the doctor looks knowledgable however he doesn't really know how to follow up with his patients  and doesn't offer any instructions for them. Dr Jabara has failed to communicate with me and did answer my questions and was not available when I needed him.",Male
I have been seeing Dr Jubati for 3 years and This is by far the worst doctor I’ve ever seen these people will give you a appointment time then won’t even show up they have done this on several occasions they have a number of people standing outside foe hours at a time waiting foe them to show up and even if they do it’s 2-3 hours later then the time you were told to be there then when you try to speak with them about them being unprofessional they say things like you’re discharged also they don’t call to verify your insurance with Medicare or Medicaid they say things like we don’t have time to call anybody that’s not our job these people are very rude and disrespectful and only care about money  this place really needs to be shut down,Male
"Dr Jabbar displayed impressive insights and tenacity in the treatment my mother's lymphocitic colitis, getting positive results where others in his field had failed.  He is an excellent listener and is well organized for his office visits.",Male
"Dr. Jabbar is excellent. He is very knowledgeable, thorough, excellent procedural skills, he listens and works hard to find out what is the source of the problems your experiencing.   I'm thankful he is my doctor.",Male
Dr. Jabbar is very thorough and compassionate. I strongly recommend him to all with any GI issues. ,Male
"I was nervous switching dermatologists since I moved, but now I can’t believe I didn’t find him a long time ago. Dr. Jabbar is amazing AMAZING!! My lupus has never been under better control thanks to him. And he is damn beautiful. I’m swooning",Male
Excellent doctor. Takes time with patient and thorough.,Male
Cant recommend anyone better. Best dermatologist I've met.,Male
"He is not a dermatologist and he practice on patients.

This guy is clueless and he dependant on other practice doctors to check the results.

Horrible and better not to visit.",Male
"Competent and very smart doctor. My husband and I as well as all of my girlfriends have had nothing but great and welcoming experiences by Dr. Jabbar. Even met someone at my local gym who is also a patient of Dr. Jabbar and we were both raving about him. Besides being good at what he does, he is such eye-candy wow. He belongs in movies with the stars!",Male
Great doc,Female
"On 12/23 had a bad experience at Arlington Hts office, bringing my son as a new patient.  Doctor came to the room, did not introduced himself, asked which mole we are concerned about, looked ONLY at this one mole, said "" There is nothing to worry about, it's benign"", concluding visit. It took about 2 min. We were expected to leave at this point. I brought up the history of skin cancer in a family. Doctor suggested "" If mother is concerned"", biopsy could be done. By then my 18 years old was quite upset and refused. Later he said that he does not want to deal with this office: during appointment he felt like nuisance, not a patient, who deserves doctor’s attention. For a first visit I would expect at a minimum, full body exam. Since I noticed that mole changed in size, I would also expect picture to be taken, and suggestion to monitor progress. I hope, doctor will get this feedback, and starts pay more attention to all his patients.",Male
Dr. Jabbar was most helpful y as I have numerous medical concerns; he listened and answered all questions.  The office is run smoothly and timely.  The staff has always been courteous and friendly.,Male
Dr Jabbar is the best doctor!,Male
I know seeing a new doctor is scary and filled with anxiety. Been there and totally understand. Dr. Jabbar and his staff really took me by surprise with the caring and consideration they showed me. Even though they wore masks (as I did) you can see the smiles and the warmth in their eyes. Dr. Jabbar LISTENS!!!! He WANTS to understand you and help you. He will create a warm caring atmosphere and definitely relaxed me. I was shocked.  I was not expecting such compassion. I was NOT expecting such understanding. I've had so much experience with doctors and hospitals and doctors my whole life as I have a blood disease that was rare when I was small. I'm 70 now and was dreading a new doctor. What was his staff going to be like? Will I be treated as a number? Will the doctor only see me as a case to study &amp; ignore my fears. I am so pleased to let everyone know the staff and Dr. Jabbar see you as a PERSON. You are not a number to them but someone with a soul. I made the best choice. Thank you.,Male
I started visiting this medical practice about a year ago. The medical staff chooses to take it upon themselves to alter my monthly medications without notifying me. I have had to find out through my pharmacy for 3 months. The staff is completely incompetent. They will cost you time and money. I would NOT visit this office if your medications are critical to your long-term health and wellness. I am highly disappointed with the level of care I received after the nurse practitioner went to work elsewhere.,Male
"They used to care, the office is by far what it was when it first opened. They lost their patients individual care. They never have the information they should have in front of them when the see you. They put you in with whoever they want and with that being said there is no communication between them. So the doctors always have blank chart.
I am really disappointed and feel like the patient is just a a money figure. It’s sad that Dr. Jabbar gave up on his practice. It shows through the work of the office. 

There are many patients including myself who are looking to go elsewhere.

What happened to Good Doctors who care at all times? Why pretend you care to grow your practice and then drop all patients you was seeing and put them in with the other docs(do not know us). Practical office would welcome new patients and schedule them with new doctors and you keep your patients. 

Your patients are not happy and it’s not only one it’s 50+.",Male
Dr. Jabbar is caring doctor takes the time to listen to his patient.  Communication with him and his staff is top notch! You won't find a better physician or staff.,Male
"Dr, Jabbar is the best. I am grateful to have him as my doctor, he is kind, considerate, caring, and very professional. I like him so much I drive 141 miles oneway. When I moved I decided to drive the 282 mile round trip just to keep him as my doctor.",Male
Dr Jabbar is the BEST Dr I’ve ever seen  I’m relieved to be in his care. He doesn’t rush you in &amp; out. He listens carefully &amp; tells you exactly what he’s found with the exam He makes sure you understand what he’s telling you. Looks you straight in the eye and tells you the truth not what you want to hear. He is a Blessing sent to me to help me get well. I trust him completely!,Male
"I can’t say enough about Dr. Jabbar. He is like an old-time family doctor with all of the knowledge and skills of a 21st century doctor. 
He will work with and even fight with the insurance companies to make sure you get the care you need. 
He takes the time to talk to you and makes you feel special just by listening to your issues. I personally use him as my shrink, because he always takes the time to listen.
He is a very caring and compassionate but can be stern and straight to the point.
I cannot finish without telling you about one of the greatest programs he is in, Patient Fusion. You can e-mail him with a message, check your appointments, check your health records everything you need to know about you at your finger tips State of the Art. One more thing, I just made the transition from private insurance to Medicare, Smooth as silk with Dr. Jabbers help. Thank you Dr. Jabbar.  Joe Stringer",Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. Jabbar for about 5 years. From day one I could tell he was different from other Dr.'s I've seen. He genuinely took an interest in my medical needs. He listened to me, I could tell that he was sincere about my best interest. I was comfortable and felt I could talk to Dr. Jabbar about any issues. 
I had COPD and I was on oxygen before I started seeing Dr. Jabbar. My situation  was worsening, I developed emphysema and was not doing well. I was resigned to let the process of the disease to continue, which would of eventually meant death. Dr. Jabbar continued to push me towards a transplant, I was reluctant, but he did not waver. He referred me to a specialist, the specialist got me into Barnes/Jewish, where I was evaluated and approved for a lung transplant. I received the double lung transplant surgery about 4 months ago and I am doing well. I no longer need oxygen, and I am up to walking 3 miles, Thanks to Dr. Jabbar!
I would recommend Dr. Jabbar to anyone!",Male
"Dr. Jabbar was very patient, taken his time to explain in detail any questions I had asked him. I think he has a lot of knowledge in how he needs to work with you  in any problems you have with your health issues, even makes you feel very comfortable where you feel that you can be open and talk about your issues you are having where most other doctors you feel uncomfortable asking or telling about any symptoms you have or want to discuss any other problem with them. I highly recommend Dr. Jabbar if you are looking for a new doctor.",Male
Dr.Jabbar and his whole staff have showed nothing but care for my family. He always listens to our concerns and does not give up till he finds the answers. He has been a life saver for my husband. I am so thankful he was recommended to us by family and friends. His Patient Fusion is my favorite. I can leave a message for him and get a reply within an hour or less. He is a caring and knowledgeable doctor!,Male
"Dr Jabbar has been a life saver for my family! We have had the same primary for many years and after feeling like my concerns were not being taken seriously, I did some research and found Dr Jabbar. From my first visit, he has shown how much he truly cares for all of his patients. My concerns were addressed and my mind was calmed. My whole family now goes to Midwest Medical Practitioners and we will always follow with Dr Jabbar! Staff is amazing and makes you feel like you are a priority. Prompt check ins, appropriate wait times, awesome Staff and clean office. Would recommend to anyone looking to take control of your health!",Male
"When my primary care physician retired after i had been with him for almost 20
Years i was so sad !!!! It is so hard to find a Dr like that who takes time and real interest in his patients health !! I tried a couple of new drs who were very nice but just not a good fit . I finally found a dr who is amazing and caring and remains me of the old school drs who really care and take a interest in your health !!! His office staff is also amazing and so very helpful . He has the best NP’s  also !!",Male
This is one of the worst doctor's offices out there they can't read MRI reports and they just take your money and ignore everything you tell them. They then treat you like dirt they were supposed to have the owner call me but instead hung up on me. I would not recommend them to anyone and I'm reporting them to the state,Male
"Dr. Jabbar opened my eyes to what an Actually Caring, Compassionate &amp; Highly Educated Doctor can be! Have only had 1 visit thus far (due to prior Dr. retiring) ...REALLY WISH I would have met Dr. Jabbar from Day 1! I would recommend Dr. Jabbar to Anyone that wants a doc that listens to his patient first, before coming to a decision. He is Very detailed, insightful, &amp; wants to get to the root cause of your issue; not just 'put a bandaid on it.' I'm more than Grateful to be a patient of Dr. Jabbar",Male
"I had been going to the same Dr for quite a few years with very little satisfaction, but since I found Dr Jabbar I have had more answers &amp; results than I have in years. He’s very kind &amp; you can tell he is really concerned about his patients!! I could continue to talk about how much I like him for quite awhile but I would like to just sum this up saying. He is the most genuine Dr. I’ve met in a very long time. He really wants to help you!!! The office staff is also very nice &amp; caring!!! ",Male
I just know dr.jabbar saved my husband life and myself he gives his all and really cares for those he treats he is more like a friend than a doctor.and i am honored to be part of it all and to call him my friend.anyone lucky enough to know him you would understand because he makes sure you come first no matter what is going on in his life.all i can say is he is a wonderful and amazing man.thank you. No matter what,Male
"Very concerned about care, takes time to explain things to you.
I have to leave 1st of the new year due to insurance that he can't take because
of getting Medicare advantage plan. But if he gets into it, I will be back.
I would recommend him to anyone.",Male
"Dr.Jabbar in one word is Wonderful. To elaborate... He listens, he really cares, he is very patient and attentive. I never feel like I'm ""just the next patient"". His staff is great. I've seen a few doctors and by far he's the best. My experience as a whole couldn't be more comfortable. ",Male
Amazing doctor ever. Very compassionate and lovely physician.  Highly recommend,Female
Worst doctor ever!!!! Never schedule your appointment with this doctor. She didn't review my test results for 6 month. Horrible experience!,Female
"If you are new to Moffitt or changing doctors, she is going to be the best... I am lucky I got her, she cares more about her patients than any other physician I have encountered. Five plus five stars for her.",Female
"Dr Jabbar is a very intelligent doctor and more so amazing person. He explained me the treatment very well , my surgery went without any issue.",Male
"I was admitted from the ER (Henry Ford Wyandotte, MI) on a Friday in June 2018 for cholecystitis due to gallstones. I was told I needed immediate surgery. The next morning, due to a lot of factors outside of Dr. Jabbar (i. e., hippa issues, blood present on bed, lack of information, etc), I refused the surgery.  Dr. Jabbar came into my room between surgeries and spoke with me at length about my condition and what would happen if I waited and what I could expect. He made me feel very comfortable.",Male
Bad experience with this doctor very rude all the time he is not a patient  person he should not be working as doctor especially with kids very nasty last visit  he make u come but don’t do anything my son is been there for 1 year of treatment and he is not getting better he just gives the same medicine all the time he does not even  care,Male
I have very awful experience. I tried to make an appointment for my sick son from last 1 week but they don’t try to help me out.. one of his male staff is very rude and his behavior is soooo nasty..  he misbehaved with me twice...,Male
Never ever visit this doctor. Worst experience with him in medical city las colinas ER. Cannot diagnose only because of his lazyness,Male
"I have found Dr. Jabbar to be professional, warm, caring and very thorough. She takes time to make sure I understand what is going on, asks for my input and permission to proceed in various ways, and follows through with treatment plans and regularly scheduled check-ups to ensure my health improves. I feel very comfortable with her and am so glad I found her!",Female
Dr Jabbar wouldnt let me tell her about different things I was having problems with. She wasn't very understanding. I left with many questions still unanswered. ,Female
"We met Dr. Jabbar and staff when my daughter was hospitalized at Hurley Children's Hospital, then diagnosed with Diabetes.  Dr. Jabbar and staff are FANTASTIC!  They have made this life changing condition a little more tolerable and have been extremely helpful. ",Male
"I got lost trying to find his office in Oakbrook, and was 15 minutes late for my appointment.  He wouldn't see me!  I explained how I waited on hold to try to speak to someone about directions while I was lost (to the receptionist) but she was trying to find another appointment for me.  Obviously if this (I hesitate to call him a doctor) person wouldn't see me -- he didn't need my $$ or the $$ of my co-workers who were waiting on my report, before they made appointments with him.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. I wish I could give ZERO stars.",Male
Dr Jabbar is now located in Oakbrook. I followed him from Plainfield and have seen him regularly for over  a decade. He found a lump on my thyroid immediately and I  have been seeing him ever since.  I trust and respect him. He is knowledgeable about many medical areas. And he treats patients with respect. ,Male
"Dr. Jabbar is excellent. I find him to be funny and straightforward, which I prefer. I've been seeing him for over a year and have lost quite a bit of weight under his care. If you are struggling with your weight, give him a try. If you follow what he says to do, you will lose the weight.",Male
"He used to be a pretty good doctor but after a few years of seeing him, he has gotten very egotistical and rude. I do not recommend at all. Wait times can also be very long when he's falling behind and the office doesn't call to give you a heads up.",Male
"Please save your time &amp; money by not seeing such a Dr. He's a pill pusher, money hungry dr! It's sad how some of these physicians &amp; pharma companies are a business. Money takes importance over a patients health. I was given so many meds that was pure negligence. There are better drs out there who will not treat you like a guinea pig.",Male
Arrogant and unknowledgeable,Male
"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  First of all,, I had to wait over 2 months for my son to get an appointment.  And then when the time finally came for him to see him, I was told that his appointment was cancelled.  I had no warning whatsoever.  Just the day before they had a machine to confirm the appointment, which I did by pressing one as indicated.  Even though I confirmed the appointment, they still wouldn't see my child even though it was their system fault. Now that is totally poor customer service.",Male
"Dr. Jabbar is an excellent doctor problem is his staff. You wait on phone a long time and he has a lot of patients. His knowledge and compassion is worth it all. He was the only doctor to diagnose me with a defective gene that relates to folic acid absorption. He is very easy to talk to and will spend the time to listen to  you.  That is why he is late a lot of times. Problems with getting  in for an appointment right away especially if you are sick. This is one thing we complain about.

"Straightforward, easy appointment. Nice guy!",Male
"I was taken right in as a first time patient referred by my GP. Dr Jabbari is excellent in explaining what he is doing and why it’s necessary. He has a very pleasant and knowledgeable way about himself. For an examination room where undressing is the norm, there’s a dismal lack of curtains, seating, and clothes hooks. Rest of the staff was friendly and professional. ",Male

Dr. Jabarri misdiagnosed me and it saddens me to see that others are still having the same problem.  Bedside manner was terrible.  ,Female
"I see a comment saying Jabbari misdiagnosed an illness and that's exactly what I was going to write. I saw her several times before realizing she was not tuning in. I got the feeling she was calling it in, not really paying attention going through the motions.  She's personable enough but if you have a real illness, my advice is to find a different doctor.",Female
A wonderful doctor. Has helped a lot with various issues.,Female
"Misdiagnosed my condition and when it got worse, refused to see me. Her nurse laughed at my condition and said very inappropriate things.  Why do some people go into medicine when its obvious they don't like patients. I won't be going back.",Female
"She really didn't listen to complaints about my pain. I injured my shoulder at work. She put me on restrictions and sent me back to work. The restrictions for my shoulder caused an injury to my other shoulder, I was still sent back to work.  I was forced to work a highly physical job with injuries to both shoulders. She would not give me a doctors excuse for work or send me in for an MRI.  Five months after my injury, I finally got an MRI. I had a torn rotator cuff. I am unable to work. ",Female
"I've used Dr. Jabbarzadeh for two ablations for afib. (1) I'm still here (very good news). (2) On each instance, he answered every question I asked in a truly caring and unhurried manner.

Dr. Jabbour is the one you want to see!",Female
There is not a more caring physician.  Dr. Jabbour takes her job seriously but does not take herself too seriously and is actually able to communicate with me like a real person.  She never talks down to me and I have more faith and confidence in her than I did any other physician I have seen.

Dr. Jabbour was consulted &amp; took over his case &amp; TRULY saved his life.

It was a terrifying, yet amazing experience because of this amazing team directed by this amazing doctor.",Male
"Dr. Jabbour not only has outstanding medical skills, he is deeply concerned with the welfare of his patient personally.  He takes the time to inform, assure and advise, as if he had no other patients who need his attention, making each patient feel secure and special.

"VA set me to him for a 2507 exam (PTSD). He was all for the VA and completely against the veteran. Would ONLY allow yes/no response.When i elaborated would cut me off saying to only answer yes/no. He falsified the report. Out of a 3. 5 hour exam spent 15 minutes interacting with this vet as he spent the majority of the time reading medical records. Out of any medical provider that I have ever seen, he was the was the worse by far. Will file a complaint against his medical license in hopes that he does not abuse fellow vets going forward.",Male
Horrible Doctor. Would give him a -10!  Brought up a concern about my 70 year old mother and he would not listen to it. He argued and ignored me! Said this is his patient. I'm her daughter and am 45 years old. I think I know a little more about MY mother. he only has 6 years with her. I have 45 years of knowledge. Besides he is supposed to take care of OUR concerns! He walked out! TOTALY UNPROFESSIONAL! Half-a! Never heard of a doctor that doesn't listen to the PATIENT'S family's concerns!!!!,Male

"Referred by my optometrist.  Spent 5.5 hours at the office (2 hrs in travel), basically playing musical chairs. Going from main waiting room to an exam room, to smaller waiting room, then see doctor briefly. This was repeated until all procedures were complete. Received very little info from the doctor, who was in a hurry to move on to next exam room. Didn't get adequate answers to my questions, nor have much time to ask any.  They should recommend patients bring a snack/lunch due to wait time.",Male
"Dr. Jabbour  is THE most competent eye surgeon I've ever encountered and I would highly recommend him to anyone.  Sometimes the wait for follow up appts can be long, yet that is generally due to the urgent cases he takes in. ",Male
"I had a very negative experience with Dr Jabbour.  I question his competence in laser.  He is too quick to recommend in-hospital procedures and tries to see too many patients to give adequate time and care.  At a nearby facility, an ophtamalogist successfully administered 100+ laser shots in over an hour; Dr. Jabbour took under 10 minutes, and the procedure failed.   I will never see him again and would recommend others to seek retinal care elsewhere",Male

I objected &amp; both the Dr and his staff critized me both verbally and in writing. 
I then made an appt with a different eye specialist. My vision problem was DX immediately and i had surgery to correct my problem.

"Deciding to undergo an elective procedure where you will have holes lasered into your eyes as well as lenses implanted is no small decision. It will not only be expensive, but you'll absolutely want a doctor you can trust.

Dr. Scott Jaben is exactly that doctor.

I visited Dr. Jaben to explore my options for vision correction. Dr. Jaben let me know that I wasn't a good candidate for LASIK because of my extreme nearsightedness. However, he did present Toric ICL as an option. That procedure involves implanting permanent contact lenses in your eyes. 

While the procedure can sound a bit scary, Dr. Jaben and his assistant Karon were able to clearly and easily describe the entire process, answer all my questions, and make me feel at ease about moving forward with the process. From the consultation, to the iridotomy, to the procedure, to the recovery, I knew I was in good hands. 

I would recommend Dr. Jaben and Karon to anyone interested in exploring corrective vision procedures!",Male
"I had the Refractive Lens Exchange surgery done by Dr. Jaben in November. I had really poor eyesight, and I was having many problems with the new, really thin contacts. I looked into Lasik and was disqualified. I was told about the RLE surgery and first decided against it because it would be elective and, therefore, not covered by insurance. The next day I decided I pay money for a whole lot of things that I don't even need so why not pay for something as important as my eyes! The surgery was uncomfortable--but not painful, and Dr. Jaben and all involved were wonderful. I did have problems seeing large ""halos"" for a long time, which affected my night driving. Others that I know who had RLE didn't have this issue, but I did (maybe because my eyesight was so bad). Because the lenses are tri-focal there are halos, but now they are small, and I have no issue with night driving. It was expensive but well worth it! I can see with no glasses or contacts! I highly recommend RLE and Dr. Jaben!",Male
"I had both lens in my eyes replaced by Dr. Jaben. I was almost blind. It was really bad. He recommended the Restor IOL multi focus lens. After I came out of surgery I could see very clearly! I do not have to wear glasses now! I love them! Dr. Jaben did an excellent job. It was painless and I feel I was blessed to have him as my doctor. His nurse was awesome too! He was the best! I am very grateful for him, and his nurse to say the least",Male
"20-20 in 2020. Dr. Jaben and his staff were everything you could ask for: thorough, professional, comforting, and overall excellent procedure. They gave me the confidence to finally get this done and improve my lifestyle.

"Traveled 4 hours for Dr. Jaben's services.  I am a future military pilot that wanted the best of the best, and I got it with Dr. Jaben.  Had Lasik procedure and my vision went from 20/400 to 20/20 in 10 minutes.   Great care.  He took the time to make sure I understood the procedure, made sure all of my questions were answered and explained the plan of care following the surgery.  He was worth every minute of the drive.

I could not have asked for better treatment from his staff.  I highly recommend Dr. Jaben and his staff for anyone considering cataract surgery.",Male
Great experience! Highly recommend.,Male
"Dr. Jaben is very thorough. He took his time educating me prior to my procedure; including a very thorough review of risks and my personal likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes. During the procedure he explained everything happening; which helped me remain calm. Post-op was more of the same: education and a review of what to expect. This level of care, patience and reassurance is rare. Of course, the fact that my surgery was successful is critical as well! I highly recommend Dr. Jaben.",Male

Dr. Jaben was fantastic talking me through the entire procedure before, during, and afterwards. I appreciated him even taking the time to wish my wife a happy anniversary after my procedure was performed on our anniversary. My only disappointment about the process is that I didn't get it done earlier. I went from around 20/400 to 20/15 overnight. When I took my glasses off before going into the procedure it was hard to imagine that I wouldn't need them any more but the results are amazing! Thank you Dr. Jaben for allowing me to see better than I have ever been able to see.",Male
Explains everything thoroughly and staff is excellent. I would definitely recommend them if your considering lasik.,Male
Been going to Dr. Jaben for 14 years.  He did my LASIK 14 years ago.  I was so pleased with the results and have enjoyed being eyeglass free.  When I developed cataracts there was no question that I would have Dr. Scott Jaben do my surgery.  I had both eyes done May 2019 and couldn’t be happier with the results. Dr. Jaben explained to me that having LASIK and then moving onto cataract surgery could pose some minor risk around focusing etc. but I’m happy to say I have none of those issues except for minor halos and he is truly the best!!,Male
"I have worn glasses/contacts since 1st grade. I was extremely near-sighted w/ contact powers being -10.5 and -9.5. Daily struggles of having to put on contacts to apply make-up, scrambling for my glasses before getting out of bed, ensuring I ordered my dailies before running out were all a pain. And there have been a few occasions I have forgotten extra contacts and/or my glasses on trips.I considered ICL for years.My research led me to Dr. Jaben. Throughout the entire process he and his wonderful staff kept me informed and were forthcoming with risks and how they would be mitigated. I did not experience any significant side effects except the occasional halos around lights. I have no challenges with driving, including at night. I use reading glasses for menus and other items. They do not have a cure for presbyopia - the farsightedness caused by ageing; however, I was informed prior to surgery of this. I'm eternally grateful for Dr. Jaben and his staff for improving my quality of life.",Male
"Had Lasik Surgery done by Dr Jaben at TLC. Very informative, talked me through every step. Very professional and got great results. Could see 20:15 by the next morning. Awesome!!",Male
"I recently had PRK done with this doctor and my experience was great! During the procedure, Dr. Jaben informed me with every step he was going to do, which made the procedure very relaxing. The surgery went well and the whole staff was very generous. I highly recommend having either Lasik or PRK done with Dr. Jaben! ",Male
"She asked me why I came, I said I think I might have an ear infection or salivary gland infection. Without looking at my chart (which noted I had another concern I wanted to ask about) she looked in my ear and told me it was an ear infection. She then asked if I use q-tips, I started to say yes and she cut me off, and said “that’s why it’s infected.” She then pointed at my face and said “your mask’s on backwards” and left the room. A nurse came in 10 minutes later with my discharge papers. I had to ask the nurse to ask her back about my other concern. She said shed write me a referral and left again. I sat in the room for 15 more minutes. I finally left the room and asked if I could leave, they printed out my referral and I left. The discharge papers gave me an actual diagnosis and details on treatment, but I think hearing it from her and being allowed to have an actual conversation is pretty basic.",Female
I've never met a more compassionate doctor. She took great care of my sick daughter during such a difficult experience.  I would recommend Dr. Jaber to everyone I know. ,Female
Dr. Jaber is the most magnificent doctor. Her intelligence and approach makes me feel so comfortable and cared for. Her detail and care is what everybody should look for in a doctor. Dr. Jaber's holistic style of medicine has changed the way I live and I thank her for that. Would recommend her to everyone! ,Female
"Nice, very friendly Dr., but more concerned with opioid prescribing ""guidelines"" than what actually works for the patient. The guidelines aren't laws. After all hollistic avenues failed, I was referred to Pain Management decades ago. Pain management is referred to patients who may have the need to be prescribed opiate pain medications over an extended period of time,or even for the remainder of their lives. Although mine and many other peoples last resort, it works. When something actually works for a persons pain and suffering, and helps improve their quality of life, it's no time to cut back their medications because of a guideline that isn't law. The so-called ""opioid crisis"" is something more applicable to the use of street drugs rather than those of us who have legitimate injuries and have gone though all the proper channels to recieve care. One of a Dr's main oaths is to relieve pain and suffering. Not create it.",Male
Love him! He actually listened to what I had to say. I wish more Doctors were like that. Dr. Jabor was a BIG HELP,Male
"We are very grateful for Dr Jaber's brilliance, knowledge, and deep commitment to fighting  certain types of cancer. It all just seems like a bad dream now, but when I look back I see Dr. Jaber as our hero. He found my husband's tumor when nobody else could, performed a perfect surgery...even took an ugly mole off of my collar bone because he couldn't stand to see it on me. He is the finest doctor / surgeon we will ever meet, I am eternally grateful to the whole office over there in Monterey Park.
If you simply must have cancer of the head and neck, you should seek out Dr. James Jaber!",Male
"I went to his office with an appointment, after 3 hours the secretary was still asking me to be waiting.! I can not imagine such a mess in any office.",Male
I can't say enough I was extremely pleased with Dr. Jaber and his staff,Male
He is disrespectful of any questions I had regarding treatment. He was impatient and rude. His misspelling and crazy emotional ups and downs were frightening. ,Male
"Excellent care, thorough examination and time spent with the patient",Male
"He’s very kind, checking on me himself multiple times rather than simply sending nurses. ",Male
"Went to emergency room with severe chest pains.  Dr. Jaber was uninterested in finding out the source of my pain after other tests came back inconclusive until my husband and I pushed him to look further.  He determined heartburn, or some variation of, as the result.  The nurses and staff were fantastic. Dr. Jaber was borderline unprofessional in his attitude and demeanor.  He made me uncomfortable. After seeing my family physician later we determined another cause.  ",Male
"I had a breakdown and called 911 as I suffer from Bipolar, Anxiety, And PTSD. He asks one question, Are you homicidal or suicidal. I say not at that moment, so he says he has to discharge me without a psychiatric evaluation. I say I'm going crazy which is why I am there and I may be suicidal if I'm out on the street. He said I already said no so he must discharge me. So I take out a lighter and start burning my hand to show how serious I am, he didn't care. It wouldn't matter if I shot myself.",Male
Dr. Jaber has been my physician for the last 10 years. I would trust nobody else to look after my health aside from him. He is kind and professional. Highly recommend.,Male
"Wait times are ridiculous, appointment times are NEVER kept can be waiting 3-4 hours to finally be seen! I do not recommend to anyone! Your time is not important to them!!",Male
Extremely long wait times for an appointment. ie. a 2:00pm appointment finally being seen at 5:00 or 6:00 pm. Borderline rude comments about patient ie. You are massive! referring to a patients size. Small talk can include him not being happy about the stock market because he lost money. Trying to use tactics to coerce a patient to do something like implying he would tell your wife on you. Very unprofessional and self centered.,Male
Amazing doctor! My daughter LOVES him!,Male
Fast and friendly. It's easy to schedule and they have weekend hours! ,Male
Great Doctor ,Male
my wife and I have been patients of DR JABBER for several years at he Marion NC office  He has always treated us with the freezing procedure when he determined it was necessary. Recently my wife Marlene Pittman got a second opinion on 2 recurring problems a place on her left shoulder that DrJabber has determined will never cause a problem was recently removed with major incisions was melanova   &amp;one one her face was frozen 3times was also cncer,Male
"WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR IN A DOCTOR?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  DR. JABER EXEMPLIFIES HER OATH WITH HER  ACTIONS. EASY TO TALK TO, EXPLAINS SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,COMFORTS YOU, GENTLE,PROFESSIONAL,CONFIDENT,UNDERSTANDS HER PATIENTS NEEDS,WORKS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS,AND VERY INFORMATIVE.  ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT AT 72 I HAVE ONLY MET ONE OTHER DOCTOR WHO IS THIS PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR WORK..BUT I  DOTHINK SHE IS #1.",Female
I have been seeing Dr Jaber since he first opened his beautiful office on Washington Square Park. I initially chose him out of convenience and his office being able to accommodate my first appointment. I have never seen another dermatologist since then. I had developed adult acne in recent years (which I thought I had grown out of in my late 20's) which was the impetus for my initial visit. Dr Jabber expertly addressed this issue and I have to say my skin has never looked better in my life.,Male
Dr. Jaber is very kind and close. Very professional and experienced. Facilities are perfect. I would recommend Dr. Jaber to anyone seeking good attention.,Male
"Zero stars if I could. Had two appointments with Dr. Jaber , thought I’d give a second chance after the awful first one. Waited nearly an hour after changing into gown. Very rushed and talks over you. Ask questions, but then answers the question on her own without giving you a chance to talk. Definitely not an environment to ask questions or get curious about anything you’re worried about. Extremely long wait times and incredibly rushed appointment.",Female
Absolutely horrible. I went to the emergency labor and delivery unit spent 6 hours in there with contractions and Dr. Jaber never came in the room to tell me what was going on even after I asked. When they discharged me the nurse was told to tell me to schedule an appointment with my obgyn first thing in the morning instead of waiting for my next appointment but would not tell me why I needed to do so. As I was gathering my items the nurse came back in and said that my baby’s heart rate had dropped extremely low during my observation (NO ONE EVER TOLD ME DURING THE OBSERVATION THEY TOLD ME AS I WAS LEAVING!!!!) and Dr. Jaber still did not come and talk to me!!!!,Female
"Honey! Let me tell you! Went to her on Monday 1/9/19.That was the roughest gyn/pap exam...I requested the pediatric speculum for comfort, as past gyn have used it. She said no and that she would use the next one up, which was small adult speculum.It literarally felt like she shoved the thing in me. She didn't allow me to relax or loosen up my muscles. I had discomfort for the next 2 days. She talked a mile a minute and kept attacking me with questions and possible PCOS diagnosis. Wrote wrong rx.",Female
"This is our first child. We found out that a test result came back abnormal so we were referred to a high risk dr. After the appt. at this high risk dr. we had questions so I called Dr. Jaber on Monday, 3/12. I get a relayed response from one of Dr. Jaber’s nurses on Wednesday, 3/14. My husband calls the next day and over the next two weeks every few days leaving messages for Jaber. It’s now Wed. 3/28 and we haven’t talked to Jaber. So sad with first experience and can’t get a hold of your dr.",Female
"She is Uninformed , I think she is Not ready to see patients on her OWN with out being Guided or Supervised by someone more Experienced then Her , she Needs more schooling !   She Misdiagnosed ME ,  I ASKED TO SEE HER SUPERIOR, because i new she was wrong,  and the other MD said No thats , Not what that is , Miss sars jaber was WRONG like I thought !!!!  shes very cold and has a lack of listening skills , when i talked to her she was discontent not warm at all seemed shallow and unrelatable .

"Caring, extremely knowledgeable, explains everything in detail and listens when I explained my concerns and answered all my questions. I would highly recommend this physician!",Male
"I have been to his office 4-5 times over the last 4 years. I find Dr. Katzman reasonably personable, professional, and well organized. There are quite a few doctors, techs, and non tech staff working there. He examined me thoroughly and detected cataracts in both eyes, plus macular degeneration that will make me blind at some unpredictable time in the future. Added a retina specialist. He and his staff can handle just about any vision related issue. I'm very particular. I like Dr. Katzman.",Male
"Dr. Ka-Widmann is a caring, wonderful doctor. when i seen her for the first time, she eased my fears and concerns as i has previously had a very bad experience with another gynecologist in 2006. it caused me not to go in for any checkups.  some bleeding led me in to see her. she was wonderful to me. she listened to my fears and concerns. she set up further tests for me that led to surger from another wonderful surgeon she recommened . everything turned out fine thanks to Dr. Ka-Widmann.",Female
Dr. Ka is absolutely amazing. I trust her wholeheartedly with my pregnancy and my baby! I feel so lucky to have found a doctor like her.,Female
So grateful to have found dr Ka I will never go to any other doctor she is knowledgeable kind and compassionate. I truly can not say enough about how wonderful dr ka and the entire practice is!,Female
"I love Dr. Ka-Widmann, she is very friendly and kind. She will take the time to discuss things with you, answer any questions and she has a very calm personality. ",Female
"Poor listening skills, refused to listen to my issues with the outcome of my surgery, I thought he was just short of telling me to shut up but I never explained my pain since the surgery.  Nasty.",Male
"Courteous, knowledgeable, professional, compassionate. Felt we were in trusted hands when he was our sons’ surgeon. Goes above and beyond for patient and family. Highly recommend. ",Male
Amazing doctor!!!! Highly recommend,Male
Thankful to have met Dr. Kaag. ,Male
Dr. Kaag recently performed a double nephrectomy on me and I can't say enough great things about him. I felt great almost immediately after and his concern about my well-being is unsurpassed. He discharged me on a Friday but not without leaving his personal phone number in case I needed him over the weekend. During our visits he was knowledgeable about my medical history and gave me all the information I needed to make a considered decision about my surgery. Thank You Dr. Kaag.,Male
Dr. Kaag did a remarkable job in rebuilding my bladder; I found him to be very caring and would highly recommend him.,Male
"Our experience happened in early 2013. Dr. Kaakaji performed 4 surgeries in a 2 week span. Our lives are forever changed because of the chain of events during this time. My wife is in constant pain and unable to enjoy most activities that she used to take for granted. A medicine chest full of prescriptions, don’t help much. After the forth surgery I had her transferred to Rush hospital in Chicago. We spent two months there. Although I believe that much of the damage was the result of the hospital staff, the ultimate responsibility falls on the surgeon. Other than the ultimate bad outcome I would have given him very high marks. Unfortunately mistakes made cost my wife dearly and changed our lives in ways we could have never imagined. I wish now that we would have gone to Rush to start with. If I can give one piece of advice, it would be, if it is a complex problem seek help at one of the teaching hospitals in Chicago.",Male
This wonderful man operated on my husband's back and got of his sciatica pain. I was with my husband at his consultation and was very impressed with the way he answered all of our questions. I plan to see him soon myself for my own health issue.,Male
He does zero follow up. He did nothing to suggest alternative treatments.,Male
"His bedside manner was good although I would suggest going to another provider if you have a complex problem. Life was changed forever and although in part because of the hospital staff, the ultimate responsibility falls on the surgeon. ",Male
No follow up ,Male
"Everyone said, ""Don't have back surgery""! Well, my pain doctor suggested I see Dr. Kaakaji , and I am so glad he did. Dr. Kaakaji operated on my back and gave me my life back. He is a caring, confident doctor who wants you to understand the proposed surgery and outcomes and takes the time it takes to answer questions.  ",Male
"We went to Dr. Kaakaji for a second opinion. He was very straight forward and explained all of our options for my husband's back very well. He is not jumping to do surgery, which my husband appreciated. I appreciated the fact that he was looking at his future potential for needing extensive surgery as well. ",Male
"Dr. Kaakaji saved my life and continues to fix my many spinal and back problems. He never recommends surgery unless it is absolutely necessary. He listens and explains bluntly what is happening. He doesn’t sugarcoat anything and explains in detail. I highly recommend that if you are looking for a compassionate, knowledgeable and caring neurosurgeon, Dr. Kaakaji is the doctor to see.  ",Male
"Dr Kaakaji has helped me. I came in the hospits from the emergency room, and could not walk and in great pain. I was sent to take an mri and found my problem was in my neck. After talking with Dr Kaakaji he operated 1 day later, he had to change something he had to do, so that he had the time to operate on me. I am very grateful, if it wasn't for him I think I would not be able to walk at all. I do have to use a walker, but I think I would not be able to walk at all if it wasn't for Dr Kaakaji.",Male
Dr Kaakaji was recommended after an MRI showed severe stenosis to my lower back.  He performed a very thorough exam and was very upfront and honest.  He explained my options well and ordered more testing to see if there was anything else going on.  During my second visit he confirmed what what found during the first visit and even recommended I get a second opinion to feel better about my future with surgery. He was very easy to talk to and took his time with me.  I will definitely be returning.,Male
I went to see Dr. Kaakaji for a back problem I was having. It was a long wait in the waiting area 2 hours after my appointment time. When I finally got to the room he didn't even spend 5 minutes with me. It seemed he was in a hurry. He also didn't give me many options to try and fix my back problem. I had to suggest physical therapy because his suggestions were to live with my pain or get surgery. I would never go back to see him. And I would not recommend him to anyone!,Male
He shoots straight from the hip....straight shot no chaser. . . He doesn't mind explaining how he sees you case individually not just lumped in a category. .... He want the best possible outcome for his patients regardless of whether he operates or not... ,Male
had first appointment and waited over thirty min.  asked what was wrong and was told computer problems  docfor was not aware of it.  i think he was late and he told me thats way it is.,Male

"Wonderful person and Doctor.  Had both cervical and lumbar surgery performed by Dr.
 Kaakaji with great results.  I would highly recommend him.",Male
Very good listener,Male
"He performed a hysterectomy on me several years ago. I had nothing but problems right afterward, and still have issues with the surgery. If I had to do it over again, I would find someone, anyone else. He was disrespectful, didn't listen to me, and didn't explain anything.",Male
Dr Kaaki is a very understanding and caring doctor. He answered all of my questions and concerns. He was extremely knowledgeable! I would highly recommend.   ,Male
"Definitely going back to Dr. Bilal Kaaki if I would have another baby. He is very concern, caring, cooperative, listened to me and answer my all questions very well. Really awesome doctor and best staff.",Male
very good Dr. Asweres all my questions very well.  its very easy to tell he truely cares about his patients.,Male
"Respectful , caring, competent",Male
Incompetent,Male
"Don't! See this ""Doctor"" for even a mild cold. He is not capable of making common sense decisions or choices. ",Male
"Don't allow this ""Dr"" anywhere near you, or your healh care team. He is incompetent, not capable of making common sense decisions and should never have been issued a license to practice medicine in the United States. ",Male
I have nothing good to say about this Doctor. He should not be practicing medicine. DON'T see this Dr for even a cold.,Male
"I have seen Dr. Kaan a bunch of times due to him being the only one who accepted my insurance. My last visit with him, I literally ran out of there crying and telling the staff that I will never be back to see him again and that I have lived with my back pain for 10 years already what’s a few more until I can find a doctor that actually cares. What is more hilarious about my last appointment is that as I was trying to get out of there as fast as I could with my back problem, he walks right into another exam room and starts laughing it up with another patient that has constantly brought him thank you gifts. He wouldn’t even read the radiologist’s MRI report that I drove myself nuts trying to get printed at the hospital that I had done it at. I’m a nursing student and yes I know nurses use their back a lot but he even tried to crush my dream of being a Registered Nurse as well, like come on Dr., you are suppose to help me, not make me feel like I’m nothing! Never again!",Male
Devastating. Huge set back in my care. Extended my suffering.  The critiques of him in his reviews are just the tip of the iceberg.  The Dr. Is irrelevant  and may decide to rethink  where he can best serve. Sincerely Greg Pendrey,Male
"I have seen Dr. Kaan twice, in Hilo, HI. 

Both times he rushed through the exam. He did not answer the questions I had written down to remind myself. One time had to chase him down the hallway to get one important question answered. 

Dr Kaan also prescribed a $700 medication without alerting me. I was shocked when I went to the pharmacy.

I am now looking to replace Dr. Kaan with a doc who will take the time to explain the nature of my problem and answer my question.",Male
Very direct and very precisely/clearly to me.  He was very efficient as far as the surgery he was going to perform.,Male

"I had a sugar count of 600 and a reaction to a z pack. Said I had a severe pain in lower back, and I believe I was having a problem with the z- pack. He didn't believe me. I didn't want to spend money for a x-ray. Which I believe wouldn't help. I asked why have the x-ray? He said he didn't believe me about the reaction. I have chf and people with heart conditions can die from z packs. But instead of trying to listen. He wanted to doctor his way. so he booted me out of office. No help 600 sugar L",Male
I do not recommend Dr Scott Karr.. In December 2017 he put a titanium plate in my arm and messed it all up and he Refuses to fix his mistake unless I quit smoking cigarettes... yes his mistake because he didnt do his measurements right and to this dayI'm in constant pain.. my neck half way down my arm locks up at times.

If he would've fixed his mistake then all would he good but he genuinely didnt seem to have much care..,Male
"Dr. Karr performed surgery on my Daughter's knee and she is doing wonderful.  From the first day we met through the last follow up visit he and his staff have been nothing but perfect, professional, informative and the list goes on.

"had an appointment with Dr Kaar and he only talked to me for 10 minutes without doing an exam. Did not knock before coming in, which was embarrassing - the PA had my changing in to my shorts and he walked in with no privacy for me. my room was across from the main desk with patient standing around who looked my direction then he proceeded to tell me I was too old for orthopedic surgery, that he was not wasting his time.   I thought he was very unprofessional and will not go back",Male
"Dr. Kaar performed surgery on my left achilles tendon, which I had ruptured.  During our first consultation, Dr. Kaar made me feel confident about his ability to repair this injury.  He answered all my questions and the pros and cons of not having surgery versus having surgery.  My surgery was performed  on 2/2/17 and went very well.  I had no post-op problems such as swelling or infection.  The surgery healed quickly and my physical therapy went well.  Dr. Kaar is highly recommended.",Male
I had an ACL reconstruction with Scott and the process has been very easy. His schedule fit my needs and helped the recovery process. ,Male

"After dislocating and fracturing my elbow, I made an appointment with Dr. Kaar. They were able to get me in quickly for an initial appointment (I was in a lot of pain). Dr. Kaar is very friendly and knowledgeable and was also able to get me in for surgery in a reasonable amount of time. He even called me the night before the surgery to check in! I am very close to having full range of motion back at my elbow joint.

Staff and residents in the office are also great.

Highly recommend Dr. Kaar!",Male
"I was having shoulder problems when I was referred to Dr. Kaar.  I was expecting to have to have surgery, but Dr. Kaar recommended 6 weeks of physical therapy.

I would definitely recommend Dr. Kaar.",Male
Dr. Kaar is an amazing doctor and phenomenal surgeon that truly cares about your wellbeing as a patient . Dr. Kaar and his staff are always upbeat and happy to see you as a patient.

"Do not be fooled by Dortor's smile. She promised many things. But, she is not a honest surgeon.  I went to see her with neuroma.  She said my big toe was not stable so I had to have a surgery of big toe area. I had a surgery in January 2018 and I have been continuing PT until now, April 2019.  With too much pain, I asked the surgery report. The first sentence, ""my patient has complained bunion for a while.  I am having so much pain bc my big toe doesn't bent.  She tricked me. Don't go to her!",Female
"I absolutely would recommend Dr. Kaas to family and friends.  She quickly figured out the problem, and her surgical skills are amazing.  Each time (hardware removal and then reconstruction) there has been almost zero swelling, and more important, pain is manageable and then quickly drops off.  After the first surgery, I returned to full mobility within weeks of the cast coming off.  The staff are all very pleasant and accommodating.",Female
"Caveat emptor. Very expensive here. Lots to pay even after insurance. 
They charged me $125 for each support sock i.e. $250 for a pair that I could buy in drug store for $25. Follow - up office visit $200. They did nothing but look at my foot. 

Initial visit was $ 515.00.",Female

"He has been my PC for years and all I can say is this man is the best ever. He has a heart of gold and the Knowledge and compassion to get to the bottom of it or lead you in the right direction. I can tell he loves his job and his job loves him. He spends time with his patient to understand the bottom problem to resolve it all. With his busy schedule and seeing so many people I know this is not a easy task,,,so this is why I love him and his wonderful staff all the time.",Male
"I have been going to Dr. Kaatz for many years and though it does not take a long time to get an appointment once you get there you could have a wait to get in to see him, but I feel it is worth the wait and if you are really sick go to the emergency room.",Male

I been waiting for prescription 5 days back and forth with pharmacy .

Also, follow-up scan was to be done, for aneurysm,  at my local hospital. Staff was unable to determine how to place request and 10 days later called to have it done at their imaging department (2+ hours away). Lastly, I sent CT scan to his imaging department three weeks before appt. and alerted his dept that it was there. He said that it was unlikely scanned in and he and his assistant were both amazed, when, at the end of my appt., they looked and it was there. Very disappointed with the whole experience.",Male
"Would not recommend going to this doctor. I was told as a new patients to show up an hour before the appointment and fill out paper work.  Filled out the paperwork and waited an hour after my scheduled appointment time , and during my additional wait  the doctor was performing telemedicine and seeing follow up patients during my extra hour wait after my appointment time. No one touch based with me about why I was still sitting there after my schedule time and I was just being ignore and just filling a seat.They do not value patient time and with the amount of people coming and going,  they rather bill a high volume of people instead of providing quality care. I rather not wait 2 hours to see this doctor , when there are better qualified doctors in the area.",Male
"I had my first visit today with Dr. Kaba's office.  From the front office to the back everyone was nice, understanding and very pleasant.
Dr. Kaba listens and is interested in what you have to say. I enjoyed my first visit, will see in 2 weeks to go over treatment plan and medications. Highly recommend this pain management office to anyone interested in professional and good quality care.",Male
"Pretty good. I'm struggling to simply walk my dog post stroke, fall with fractured coccyx. Weight loss causing weakness and atrophy. I'm hopeful but frustrated. 3rd visit in a week.",Male
Nice doctor. Staff was very friendly. My back pain has improved without having to take medication that knocks me out and is addictive. Highly recommend going here before talking to a surgeon.,Male
Dr. Kabach is wonderful and I recommend him to everyone. He is so thorough and looks at the whole picture. His bedside manner is one of a kind. He will sit down and listen to you. He takes the time to explain everything so that you understand what is going on. He has the best communication skills. You can tell he really cares and is very knowledgeable. I can not recommend him enough.,Male
"Very bright, knowledgable and sometimes caring and concerned but other times rude, condescending and chronically late.The last time I saw her, I waited an hour, could hear her in the halfway laughing and joking. I finally left; she called me later to say she’d had an emergency and that’s why she was late.  She shared way too much personal info i.e. how her brother died, her dating life etc. Its a shame...I think she has a lot to offer but needs huge improvement with her interpersonal skills. Never went back. ",Female
I saw her at Shiley/Scripps on Torrey Pines and was put off by her condescending attitude and inability to keep her appointments.  She was NEVER on time and I found it rude in its' consistency. She was thorough in explaining the lab results and she was very fluent on the lipid tests and the latest trends in that area.,Female
"I wish I would have read the review here before visiting Dr. Kaback. She lacks empathy; is chronically late; she is condescending; she doesn’t welcome any questions about your health, although she may ask is you do have a question, but the will abruptly cut you off mid-question; she lacks professionalism and isn’t even thorough, as she lacked a memory of why I even came to see her in the first place. I have the ultimate respect for doctors, but her arrogance and lack of kindness are horrible.",Female
"Dr. Elizabeth Kaback is not the doctor you want to see unless you want to feel horrible about yourself, belittled, yelled at and starred down as if you have no idea what you are talking about when you try to discuss your concerns. I wish I didn't even have to give her one start to write this review. I just want to encourage people to seek treatment from other doctors. There are plenty at Scripps that will consider your feelings. Just not HER.",Female
"Dr. Kaback is great! She is attentive to detail, easy to communicate with and makes you good about your plan to stay healthy. I am happy with her and her staff. I consider myself blessed to have Dr. Kaback as my doctor.",Female
"So sweet, kind and sincere, an angel on earth!",Female
"I fell down a flight of stairs backwards and absolutely destroyed my shoulder and upper humorous. They were dislocated and broken. Long story short, Dr. Kaback rescued me from the bowels of a hospital basement, literally. He repaired my injuries without having to operate and I am forever grateful. I have never experienced the level of professionalism and sympathy from anyone in my life that Dr. Kaback showed me when I met him and he continues to show me with every encounter since then! The doctor, his surgical team and office staff are amazing!",Male
I had a shoulder that had been destroyed by arthritis .  It was very painful.  Following an MRI I was referred to Dr. Kaback for a total shoulder replacement.   I am 6 weeks out with 1 PT session and I am close to full movement.  Amazing and a joy to be without pain.  Now I don’t even think about my shoulder at all.  No pain at all!  He is professional but with a great sense of humor which is important day.  I consider myself very lucky to have been treated by Dr. Kaback!  First class treatment!,Male
"Dr Kaback repaired a shoulder a little over a year ago.  I now have more range of motion, strength, and less pain than I have had in decades.

My highest endorsement is this ...  I just scheduled an appointment for my other shoulder",Male
Dr. Kaback is a skilled surgeon.  I am so glad he fixed my rotatory cuff.  I am pain free after years of suffering.,Male

"I highly recommend DR. Kaback for shoulder surgery. I had rota cuff surgery and from the first appointment to my latest follow up, Dr. Kaback and his staff gave me outstanding service. 
Starting with his reception staff, nursing, and to his OR staff and of course Dr. Kaback himself gave top care at all times at all levels. 
When I walk out of my appointments Dr. Kaback answered every question and gave me all the time I needed. 
Dan Dillon, my surgery was in 4/16/2020",Male
"I cannot speak highly enough about Dr. Kaback, Pavel and staff, they are professional and courteous. Having torn rotator cuff in both shoulders I trust Dr’s expertise and would recommend him highly Thank you doctor!",Male
I had a torn rotater cuff repaired by Dr. Kaback in June. He and his team went above and beyond my expectations. I felt very comfortable and confident after my first few visits that I was going to have successful surgery. I am happy to say that three months later I am back to full use of my shoulder! I can't express enough how wonderful this whole group is.,Male

"excellent communicator, surgery went well",Male
"Dr. Kaback and his team are so caring, knowledgeable, professional and their office runs like very smooth.

His assistant Jacqueline is completely on her game and is kind, caring and on top of everything - GREAT team! Highly Recommend!",Male
"Dr. Kaback repaired my left elbow in surgery and applying a pin to hold the bones in place. Thank you to Dr. Kaback. I now have 100% mobility in my left elbow with no stiffness. I am a 74 year old female with hearing problems. Dr. Kaback treated me with respect as well as members of my family who accompanied me to appointments.
Thank you Dr. Kaback.",Male
"I made an appointment with Dr. Kaback after experiencing years of shoulder pain due to osteoarthritis and seeing other orthopedic  surgeons.  An arthroscopy by one of these practitioners gave me about 6 weeks of minor relief.  Dr Kaback immediately  told me I needed two NEW shoulders and that he didn't understand why the arthroscopy had been done when I had such severe deterioration and bone spurs.  After the explanation of his planned less-invasive surgery procedure, I opted to have surgery ASAP.  The experience was amazing.  Having had 2 knee replacements, I was expecting day of hospital stay, followed by weeks of painful rehab.  I was home the day after surgery and suffered only moderate discomfort for a few days.  PT was totally painless and was back to most activities within a few weeks.  Couldn't wait to get the other shoulder done.  Same great results.",Male
Had a very severe shoulder injury from a bad fall. After seeing Dr. Kaback he scheduled me for immediate surgery due to the severity of the injury. Prior to surgery I was unable to move my arm at all. I am very happy to say that now I have full movement and use of my arm and feeling no pain whatsoever. I am very grateful to have been taken care of by such a wonderful Doctor. I would highly recommend Dr. Kaback and Ortho NY to anyone in need of Orthopedic care.,Male
"I knew I had a shoulder problem but delayed seeking help out of uncertainty.  My husband's physical therapist recommended Dr. Kaback.  He diagnosed a partial tear of my rotator cuff and during surgery found and repaired a total tear instead.  I can't say enough good things about how that surgery has changed my life for the better.  From Dr. Kaback's surgical expertise, with excellent explanations of the procedure and what to expect afterwards, to post op care, I have rarely encountered such a skilled, empathetic physician.  Recovery was slow (lots of PT) but in the end to really have full use my arm again and live without pain is something I am thankful for every day.",Male
"I was scheduled to have a total right shoulder replacement with another doctor on May 10, 2019.  I was told on May 3 that the damage was too extensive and was recommended to see Dr. Kaback.  He was able to see me about a week later and performed the surgery on May 23, 2019.   Dr. Kaback  did a fantastic job.  His skill and bedside manner are amazing.  He has answered all of my questions in ways that are easy to understand.  All follow up visits have been great.  I would highly recommend anyone to see Dr. Kaback.",Male
Dr. Kaback has performed two surgeries  (on my right shoulder and right elbow).  He was very professional and did a great job.  I would recommend him to anyone looking at these kinds of surgeries.,Male
I had a posterior dislocation of my clavicle that was missed after a soccer injury at the ER visit after an ambulance ride. I went to Dr. Kaback 2 days after and he ordered a stat CT scan which showed this dangerous and rare injury that required thoracic surgery. His diagnosis was key and spared me from much more excruciating pain. He is a great doctor who listens to the patient and went above and beyond to figure out this extremely rare injury that would have otherwise been mistaken for something less severe. The surgery was risky as the clavicle was near major arteries and the lungs so it was emergent surgery. I’m so thankful for Dr Kaback!,Male
"My daughter is a wrestler.  She tore the MCL in her elbow.  She was concerned about Tommy John surgery and the length of recovery.  Dr. Kaback went above and beyond to find a new surgery that she was a great candidate for.  The new surgical procedure allowed her to start training and competing a little less than a year.  She is now two years out of surgery and competing at the collegiate and national level with little to no elbow pain.  He provided us with all options and provided us with extensive information on the new surgery.  His bedside manor was great and he listens to his patients and tries to find alternative options to fit their needs.  
I also have seen him recently for my shoulder.  Where numerous doctors dismissed me because of my age and weight, he heard my symptoms out and instead of dismissing me to arthritis, he found an injury to my rotator cuff.  He gave me physical therapy and if that doesn't work surgery to relieve the pain.",Male
I had surgery to remove adhesions in my shoulder in April 2019.  The care provided by Dr. Kaback and his team could not have been better.  I went into the surgery feeling confident and well-informed.  I had no post-op pain (your mileage may differ!) and quickly returned to my regular activities at work and home.  Follow up care has also been top notch.  I highly recommend Dr. Kaback!,Male
"Dr Kayback is the best of what he does in all areas. You trust him immediately and have complete confidence in him. It's how he conducts himself and how well he treats his patients. I truly believe he saved my vision.
You can look around but you won't find anyone better than Dr. Kayback.",Male
"Office wait times are so long. Typically 45 min to 1 hr at least! They always double book, as in everytime we go there is another appt scheduled at the same time with the same doc. EVERYTIME!!!!  The phone lines are always busy or never answered. The doctor is rude and rushes you and seems uninterested in any questions or concerns you have. This is the worst doctor I have ever dealt with. He needs to retire.",Male
I would gladly recommend Dr. Kabadi to family and friends.  He's been my cardiologist for about 2 years now and I would have no problems recommending him to someone else.,Male
Dr. Kabadi has gone above and beyond to treat my orthostatic intolerance when other doctors said they couldn’t help me. I’m incredibly grateful that he’s been willing to help me even though my diseases don’t fall under the endocrinology specialty. He’s a brilliant doctor and I’d highly recommend him,Male
Knowledgeable. Great manner. Improved my treatment considerably. ,Male
"Dr Kab acts like his word is gospel. Much more interested in blaming all womens issues on hormones. Not a good listener!
No other Dr in this department leads to a total lack of objective diagnosis . ",Male
"he seems very knowledgeable and asks the right questions. i drive 2   hours to see him, i would drive 3-4. he explains things and takes the needed time with me.",Male
"Dr Kabaei has performed two surgeries on me and I couldn't be more pleased with the process and the results.  In January 2019 Dr. Kabaei repaired a plateau fracture of my right tibia with a plate and screws and in September 2019 he performed a total hip replacement of my right hip. Both surgeries were flawless with perfect results.  Dr Kabaei fully explains the process, patiently answers all questions, is highly skilled and has a great bed side manner.  I give him the highest rating.",Male
If I could leave negative stars I would. This doctor simply doesn't care about the well-being of his patients. I recently changed insurance providers and this doctor has refused to transfer my active prescriptions. My medication is now gone and I'm already feeling the negative effects. I'll never return to Kaiser Permanente after this.,Male
"Dr. Kabak is an excellent physician. I see him for asthma and sleep apnea. I trust his judgment completely. I have been his patient for years, which includes 3 pregnancies. During illness and asthma exacerbation while pregnant, his follow up was outstanding. He called me personally to see how I was doing and sometimes his nurse would call also to make sure I was taking meds as prescribed and to check on my recovery. I'd recommend Dr. Kabak to any family member or friend needing a pulmonologist.",Male
"Dr Adam Kabaker has been great through my thyroid surgery, he’s super chill and a really nice guy. I was lucky enough to talk to him a couple of days after my surgery on the weekend when I thought I was having problems. Two thumbs up.",Male
Untrustworthy as a doctor and a person.,Male
"I been going to him since I was about 16 and am now 28 years old. I went to other doctors in the beginning for severe abdominal pain that other doctors continued to blame on my menstrual. When I finally went to Dr. Kabakibi he found that I had a cyst and had to be removed immediately. I wouldn`t change doctors no matter what because god knows what could of happened if I never had gone to him. Also his staff make you feel comfortable, and the new doctors that now work with him are phenomenal.",Male

He is great! very understanding!,Male
Has taken care of my pain in a professional and kind way. ,Male
Very mean uncaring man that likes to yell as patients for no obvious reason. Not sure if he's having personal problems or got caught doing something shady but I heard some very loud conversations or arguments or something and then watched 2 patients storm out and slam the door behind them while I was waiting to be seen. And let's just say he was less than courteous when I was finally seen.,Male

"I was his patient for years and one day he no longer accepts bcbs insurance.  They told me to find another doctor.  The lady said that he only want Medicare patients because he makes more money on older people. She said he didn't need anything else. I was shocked. I thought he was a caring doctor. I was so wrong. Don't trust that place.
He really doesn't care. Only cares about money. 
",Male
"Be careful, I saw Dr. K for years, I thought we were friends. He helped me with my condition. and all was well. Once day, they said all your appts. are cancelled, and we no longer accept your insurance. And Dr. K. no longer needs self pay.

He completely abandoned me, this is after my paying his huge expensive bills. Very scary stuff, be careful, you might want to seek a better and less secretive doctor. His office staff has huge turnover, he cannot keep employees, cameras everywhere. I don't kn",Male
I have been a patient for 10 years.  I have been satisfied with the several surgeries and medical treatments by Dr. K.  I would recommend him to anyone needing a pain management specialist.,Male

"Dr. Kabalkin is  very knowledgeable, attentive, and caring. He is compassionate towards patients, takes time to listen, and does complete physical exam.  Excellent physician. ",Male
The doctor speaks clearly and listens well which are key to a good office experience. He has a great deal of experience in his field and inspires confidence when he shares that knowledge with the patient. By assessing my concerns promptly and correctly he led me to take the steps which were necessary to probably avoid a heart attack. All in all an excellent physician.,Male
I found dr kabalkin to be quite considerate and understanding. he is also quite knowledgeable. all my experiences with dr kabalkin have been pleasant ones.,Male
My family member is being treated by Dr. Kabanskaya at Good Samaritan.  My family member has severe gastroparesis.  She asked the doctor to verify her potassium levels and basically ignored her.  We the parents had to push to get in hospital blood testing done in an emergent manner to prevent her from crashing.  This doctor does not know what she is doing.,Female
"My family member was recently treated by Dr. Kabanskaya at Good Samaritan. Her communication skills are horrible.  She was irritated when asked questions and gave conflicting information to nursing and hospital staff, even they seemed embarrassed by her behavior.  Her lack of attention and concern for her patients is appalling and  potentially life threatening. ",Female

No long waiting time. No appointment needed.takes time to listen to your questions. Very professional.,Male
His office manager is rude and constantly hanging up the phone on me. I have never in my life been so disrespected before. I simply called about my refills and she told me to leave a message. I believe I even her say something derogatory towards me. I just can't believe a nice doctor like this would have a mean woman running his office. Says alot about the kind of person she is. Would give five stars but with her working there I rather give one and go to another doctor. ,Male
Dr. Kabaria is a good doctor who takes the time with patients to explain and answer all questions and diagnosis. ,Male
"Dr. Kabaria is a very caring doctor. He is still firm and by the book, and follows rules and regulations to the tee, so don't take his kindness as a weakness, he will put you in your place. The only problem when you have a good doctor is a packed waiting room. But once you get to the back and it's your turn,  he will spend as much time as you need until you feel comfortable and all your questions are answered.  He still has that nice old fashioned bedside manner. ",Male
"My husband has required pain mgmt for several years and is a new patient of Dr. Kabaria. Very thorough regarding my husband's medical history and suggested different treatment options along with medication.

"Office is very unprofessional, they schedule 10 people for appt at same time, you get there on time for appt at one, and the staff goes to lunch at that time, very rude, you wait anywhere from 2 to 3 Hrs just to see the Dr for 5 minutes. Only go to this Dr. if you have half a day to spend waiting, in a hallway. No respect for your time at all.

"Dr. Kabazie is one of the finest Doctors in Pennsylvania he takes them time to explain every Step,  he diagnosed my condition right away and took the appropriate steps to correct the problem, he is professional and kind.

Dr Kabzie is a condescending and rude doctor. His bed side manners need serious work. I felt like another number when I saw him. Will not revisit. ,Male
Rude and treats every patient he sees like they are going to abuse medicine if he prescribed it. I have talked to four other patients that day they will never go to him again. ,Male
"This Dr had decided that he would not be taking me on as a patient before he even met me. I am a young professional who WAS NOT LOOKING FOR DISABILITY and was only their for his opinion.

"Never met him, he wouldn,t allow it, He thought this was funny.  We talked on the phone at 4pm, thursday, Sept 8th.  I told him what happened with my visit to the Bloomfield Pain clinic with Ryan Flannery.  I waited an hour in exam room before another Dr. came in and asked ?'s he left.

"It was a follow up visit for my son, Alhasan Lateef. The doctor was highly humanitarian and ficused in my son’s food, exercise and insulin program. He is excellent in his profession. This is what I know about him since 2012 when visited him for the first time.",Male
"Dr. Kabbani has been a wonderful doctor for our son, who was diagnosed as a Type 1 diabetic in 2017.

He has gone over and above what you would expect most doctors would do for the care of their patients.  On one occasion, a few days after our son was released from the intensive care unit, which is when we found out about the Type 1 diabetes, we had to take him to the Emergency Room.  The ER doctor wanted to get in touch with Dr. Kabbani to discuss treatment.  Even though this was 10pm on a SUNDAY night, Dr. Kabbani returned his call!  He even made a follow up call about an hour later to make sure that things were going well.

Another time, we were having trouble with the Pharmacy filling one of our prescriptions.  Dr. Kabbani got in touch with the Pharmacy to straighten out the problem.  This was on a SATURDAY afternoon!

So, you can see how important his patients are to him, when he is available for them even late at night and on weekends.

I highly recommend Dr. Kabbani.

So, I'll follow up with a complaint to my insurance company and the board. Initially i thought I found a provider that(wasn't quite at the level we were used to seeing in Princeton but,we thought he was ok).I find it unethical to adjust my kids insulin then not see him because your staff didn't bill tricare timely and you didn't get paid a miserable 140$.

"Will never recommend him. He had told me my kids acted  ridiculous who are 2&amp;3 and were sitting talking to each other during the visit, told me to have a babysitter for next appointment.

"met our new Endo Dr. Kabbani and he was great.  He was kind yet educated my oldest on why it is important to have good numbers.

DISGUSTING.  how can this man call his self a Dr and be totally nasty like that.  never goin back ever,Male
"I will never go back to this place! I like the staff, but the Dr. Kabbani is horrible!",Male
Dr. Kabbani is an excellent doctor who because of him he gave me brand new feet. Because of that I wear the correct size sneakers. I tell all my friends and family and neighbors to go to him.??,Male
"Dr. Kabbany was fantastic! He was funny, thorough, informative and truly listened to our concerns. I was very happy with Dr. Kabbany!",Male
"After a year of Crohn's symptoms/diagnosis but no treatment by our local pediatric GI group, we sought help at Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Kabbany was quick to reassure us that she IS very ill and with thorough examination and testing he diagnosed her with active Crohn's for which we start treatment soon. He was the FIRST specialist to validate my daughter by telling her, ""you are not sick because you are depressed, you are depressed because you are sick.""  we HIGHLY recommend Dr. Kabbany.",Male
"I have been Dr. Kabbany’s patient for about 2 years. He is always willing to explain or answer any of my concerns or questions. He is able to explain in detail in a way that is understood. 
His approach feels like he is genuinely interested in my health needs,
( I have had doctors in the past that didn’t make me feel that way) 
I highly recommend Dr. Kabbany.",Male
"Made the mistake of making him my pcp under new insurance. Very condescending, and arrogant, treated me like I didn't know about my own health conditions.",Male
"Dr Kabbara has been treating my chronic back pain for years. I see him for treatment. He gets relief. I go several years until i need to be treated again. Before seeing him it could take me up to an hour every morning to loosen my back up enough to move with a tolerant level of pain. After the first treatment i was pain free for almost 4 years!

Read about the average length a doctor can see any one patient and its about 5 minutes or they lose money due to insurance payment restrictions. Doctors are all to the point. They have to be. Dont complain about the doctor. Complain to your insurance carrier. They're the ones limiting doctors time with patients. Dr Kabbara gave me my life back.",Male
"Dr. Kabbara in my opinion is one of the most caring Doctors I have ever met. I have had 4 Back surgeries and I have 6 screws and 2 rods in my lower back. My main problem is that my body does not respond to any Pain Medications. So having any surgery, the pain is excruciating and nothing helps. I went to every Pain Management Doctor I could find and either they would said I can not do anything for you or give a Epidural injection. So when I saw Dr. Kabbara , he asked about all my procedures and then he laid out a plan for me. We tried many different drugs with daily follow ups, then a Temp. implant TENS Unit, no help. So we would tried one last thing. A Epidural injection with straight morphine into my back were the injury was. It worked but, only for a day, but I got some relief. So I got a Morphine Pain Pump implant. I think that Dr. Kabarra and his Nurses are the most professional that I have been with and my wife is a Nurse herself. I have been seeing hem for 5 years with no problem",Male
"This man was a complete jerk. He totally lied to me about everything up front, what he was going  do, how it would feel, what he would do to prevent my additional pain, and how it would help me. He did not care about my pain, before, during or especially the level 10 pain i endured after a 24 needle procedure in his hands. The only thing he seems willing to do is injections - period - that he tormented me during, and would not even stop when I asked him to, for a minute - more concerned about his other overbooked pending injections  that day. Before I  got to recovery, I was in a total living hell, that only grew worse over the next 35 minutes, and 36 hours respectively, that i waited to see him again.All he wants to do is put needles in you, and get paid - period!!! And which I only agreed to because he wouldn't do anything else what so ever unless I let him stick needles in me, despite my  having a bad history with needles, that  explained to him.  Then he bailed on me, 100%, smiling",Male
"I honestly do not comprehend these poor reviews of this wonderful physician. Quick facts about myself: I am a certified medical professional. I am support group provider for RSDSA and RSDHope.I am also US Pain Foundation Ambassador for Ohio. I was injured 6/2011. Simple trip and almost fall. Sprained my entire RT leg. Developed RSD 7/2011.First appointment with Dr.K 8/2/11. Spread full body 11/11. Recently after much BWC court battles he and the Ketamine Infusions were approved. I’ve taken members to other OH facilities and they were nightmares and no way was I going so I told him I wouldn’t until the powers that be let him have K Clinic. Finally this year. I was scared silly because of the nightmares I witnessed.He sang me to sleep and he not resident was at my bedside every 30 min. My RN almost whole time. Had it twice and great outcomes.Not once treated bad by anyone.He’s compassionate,kindhearted,funny and very smart. I’m a challenging case. He’s the best PM &amp; K clinic in Ohio.",Male
Been a patient for many years with a few different problems.  Always helps.,Male
"     I have been seeing Dr. Kabbara for over six years and I do not understand the negative reviews.  Dr. Kabbara worked with me for many years, he used pain meds, injections and finally I did a trial stimulator to see if that would work.  It took over five years to get to that point because of insurance,  best decision of my life!  He does not give up on his patients.  You may not like what you hear because he is honest and doesn't just hand out meds but looks for a long term solution.",Male
"Dr. A. Kabbara is very knowledgeable in Pain Management.  Dr, Kabbara is direct when explaining what is causing your pain, and what help reduce if not removing most of the pain.  I find he is very particular in doing whatever you need as an explanation of what procedure would be best for your pain.  This Dr. does not sugar coat or talk in circles about all he can do for you. His staff and receptionists are awesome. Vickie, his CRNP is kind, and is thorough. Doc's direct support staff is Awesome.",Male
I have been treated respectfully by pain management at the Cleveland clinic for 6 years. When insuranced changed I saw this dr. He was dismissive..and refused to treat me unless I agreed to surgical implant of electrical stimulator. I chose not to do this and was told he was unwilling to provide me with another option. For those of us that are in chronic life long pain...do not see this dr. It seems as though he must be paid commission on selling pain pumps and stimulators. I found another dr.,Male
My personal experience with Dr Kabbara was very disappointing. I found him to be very aloof and impersonal. My last procedure in March 2018 he didn't even speak to me before or after the procedure? I've have to admit I have never experienced that situation with a medical doctor. After the procedure I experienced terrible side effects over the weekend. I called their office on Monday at least 20 times and couldn't get a live person to answer the phone? I will be looking for a new doctor!,Male
Unfortunately he shows little caring about the pain your in. Other than setting up procedures such as nerve blocks etc.. Unfortunately if those don't work. He  does nothing in between these procedures to help with pain. Never met a dr who cares so little about managing your pain.,Male
"I do not understand any negative feedback regarding Dr. Kebbara or his support staff.  Dr. Kebbara is extremely caring,  addressed all my questions and concerns and explained in detail his reasoning for the procedures that would help me.  His staff has always been the same - kind, full of knowledge about the procedure and also answered all questions I had.  He has an extremely friendly and caring bedside manner and his support staff reflects his care and concern for his patients.",Male
"Dr. Kabbara is an excellent doctor! He spends time talking to me and answers all of my questions/concerns. I have SO many doctors. I can honestly say that Dr. Kabbara is one out of a couple of my doctors that's sympathetic and genuinely wants to help me. Dr. Kabbara's rating is low bc of his staff. Vicki--the NP, is terrible, &amp; doesn't provide quality care (She should be fired). The head nurse &amp; staff are disrespectful to patients. Staff needs to be replaced as it reflects poorly on Dr.Kabbara.",Male
I was charged a fee just enter and use the facility.   Over $200.  This is on top of the regilar office visit charge.  Seriously?  Am I supposed to have my office visit on the sidewalk?   Across the street?  I refuse to pay.  I won't be visiting this facility again.  Shame on you St. John's Westshore.,Male
I've been going to Dr. Kabbara for several years now and I really like him and his staff. They are all so very caring and understanding. Would definitely recommend him to anyone. ,Male
"I am actually very surprised to see any negative reviews and feedback about Dr. Kabbarra. I am a fairly new patient of his, but I have found him to be very competent, explanatory, intelligent, personable, caring, understanding, and helpful. He truly took the time to listen, explain, and address my needs, without making me feel rushed or uncomfortable. Wonderful doctor, great staff. ",Male
Dr Kabarra is fantastic. He listened to my concerns and formulated a plan accordingly. He and his staff are very caring people. I highly recommend them.,Male
"To add from my further review, the nurse took my blood pressure and it was 245-145, took it again and it was about the same. She said I'll take it before you leave, she never did. You would think maybe this guy is ready to have a stroke or heart attack with blood pressure like that... Luckily I did not have a heart attack, just the worst medical care I have ever received, and I have a very large sample....DONT WAIST YOUR TIME!!!",Male
"I've been seeing another pm dr for about two years with a debilitating neck and back problem, but I had to leave that dr due to him no longer accepting my type of insurance. So I had to seek out a new dr and I chose dr Kabbara, big mistake. He removed all my pain medication and wants me to take a nerve pill without ever seeing an x-ray or ct scan.  I should have listened to the other reviewers.",Male
"Dr. Kabbara is more interested in his appearance than his patients. He does NOT listen to either his patients or their families. He doesn't do physical examinations or order any type of imaging. He insisted I go off meds I've been on for years, just because HE didn't approve. He never explained the treatment program he devised, and his office billed my insurance for a procedure I never had. His office staff were always rude whether in person or on the phone. Run, Run, Run from this physician!",Male
Dr W. Kabbara and his staff are always friendly.  They listen to are always fast to help us.  Dr. Kabbara always call me back when I've had to page him after hours.  Always very nice and caring. ,Male
"He was initially my mother's physician then through his care of her I personally transitioned to him for my care. He is genuinely intetested in determining the causes for illlness rather than just ""writing a script."" He is approachable and listens well to effectively diagnosis even rare conditions as was the case foe my mother ",Male
" This doctor has went from being a good caring doctor to a doctor who only cares about the money. My husband is a very sick man, just lost his transplanted kidney and is back on dialysis. He has back and neck injuries, high blood pressure and is in a-fib. He needs his medications. Dr. Kabbara had his receptionist call the day of appointment to tell us if we didn't pay a big amount of our bill he would not see him. I am making a complaint with the board of medicine.",Male
"He told  I looked like I didn't feel well, I told him why I wasnt feeling well, then had a what do you want from me attitude. I thought he would be one of the better doctors in beckley, but I thought wrong. He had a spotty attitude as if I'm burdening him with my presence. Now I'm left wondering if I can trust him as a physician, or if he's going to cop an attitude. ",Male
"Excellent staff.. friendly and very accommodating with scheduling - will work you in on short notice.
Respectful of your personal and private matters even when waiting room is full.
Dr Kabarra is genuinely and professionally interested in your issues and concerns without making you feel rushed and really seems to take a personal interest in your feelings and well-being.

He is a amazing person as well as a doctor. He saved my life and found out what was going on with me when nobody else wanted to or tried to. He has also helped my husband in so many ways when no other doctor would help. He sent him to specialist to help figure out what was going on. I want to take the time to say tha k u to him.

Prior to finding her, I had seen over 5 doctors for the same condition, all of which dismissed the extreme pain and instability I was experiencing in my right ankle.

After going to 2 other doctors, one  tried to rush me into surgery, the other doctor said he would be more comfortable have Dr. Kabbash look at my MRI because he wasn't sure if he should do surgery. Dr. Kabbash explained very precisely what she would do IF she operated, but told me she would rather see me try to go without surgery instead, and to pay very close attention to her instructions, and I should heel fine. I did and it did.",Female

"Be prepared to wait, she double books time slots. I waited 90 minutes for my first visit, 37 mins for second visit and 45 mins for third visit. She is personable &amp; has a good bedside manner, but it is disrespectful to be kept waiting so long.

The good: Dr. Kabel is great at medication management and at finding the right medication for you.

The bad: 
 Dr. Kabel  seems to only care about money.  What’s wrong with a physician that cares about money? - nothing at all.  They went to tons of school, but alongside money should be respect for the patient and caring (even if it has to be faked).  He will start a 30 minute session 4-5 minutes late and try to wrap it up a couple minutes early.  But at his cash pay rate, as he doesn’t take insurance, this can be $5 a minute of lost time.  I mean scheduling another visit should be after he has completed the current one - not during it.

He charges you t",Male
"Dr Kabel has helped me with a heavy OCD (touch-tap-count) disorder, he helped through a break-up of 7 years which was very traumatic on me mentally. He’s a great LISTENER and I couldn’t say a bad thing about him. I totally, positively recommended Dr. Kabel.",Male
"Beware.  Dr. Kabel can hand out medications like tic-tacs.  After watching my adult son decline over a 2 year period with the cocktail mix of drugs prescribed by Dr. Kabel, I finally convinced my son to see another specialist.  He's reduced his medications to 2 (from 6!) and is doing so much better!",Male
Dr. Kabel makes you feel comfortable talking about any issue. He's professional and truly cares about his patients.  He listens and offers great advise that I have applied time and again. He has truly helped me.  ,Male
" I would NOT recommend Dr. Kotler. While Doctor Kotler does spend extra time with the patient, she comes into the initial appointment with a specific diagnosis already in mind and asks VERY leading questions to get the patient to answer questions agreeing with her pre-determined conclusions.  She often does not listen to or take the child or parent's input.   

Dr. Kotler is very scattered and jumps to new medications and combinations before being able to tell if they are effective or not.   On occasion, she could not read her own notes and forgot which medication and dosage she had last put my child on or how long it had been since the medication change.

If your child has behavioral concerns that seem to go beyond that of what your pediatrician can handle, go see a child psychiatrist with specialized training and experience in behavioral health!",Female
"Dr. Caroline has been our ninja warrior in our mental health plight with my two children. I never thought I would be ""that parent"" who would put their kid on meds because they couldn't handle being a good parent. I finally gave in when my son begged me to take him to the doctor because he was so depressed. To my surprise, my children were tested and both have ADD, depression, and anxiety. This is where we met and fell in love with the brilliant, compassionate, and loyal ""Dr. Caroline"" as we call her in our house. We have her on speed dial on our phones and she is always available when we are in need.  I am a single parent and am so grateful to have her as an advocate. She is truly genius.",Female
"Doctor Koler is one of the best.  She understands and relate to children and young adults in a way that I’ve never experienced before, nor had my children.  She treats the whole child, mind and body.",Female
"Dr. Kotler is absolutely brilliant; she treats our children not only with very personal care and an incredibly impressive, scientific mind, but as if they’re her own.  Dr. Kotler connects with each teen and meets that individual where they are.  She has extraordinary compassion and empathy but Dr. Kotler is tenacious for comprehensive answers where other medical professionals give up if things are atypically complex, medically speaking.  

Dr. Kotler is one others should use as their role model for making vulnerable patients feel seen, heard, precious and safe.  Dr. Kotler is one who digs in, asks the right questions and elicits the answers that help make for positive changes not only medically, but academically, emotionally, and socially contributing to a students’ overall well-being. 

Don’t delay it for a minute - call and get in to visit with Dr. Kotler.  There aren’t enough wonderful things to say about this genius mind.",Female
I have seen several doctors that just dismiss my child as having ADHD yet the meds for that never seemed to work. Dr Kotler was able to correctly diagnose my child and treat him appropriately! Dr Kotler has made my child so much more stable and able to function and focus in all aspects of daily life while allowing him to still be the sweet silly boy that he is!,Female
"Dr. Kotler  is a warm , compassionate, amazing doctor.
She really gets teens and adolescents. 
We are very blessed to have found her.",Female
Dr Kotler has made a huge difference in my children’s life.  Her help with treating their anxiety and depression has been a game changer.  I can’t say enough about this amazing doctor.,Female
"Dr Caroline has done AMAZING things for my 3 kids.  Her expertise in understanding DNA testing is unsurpassed!  She does not take insurance, but I have not had an issue submitting her bills for reimbursement.   Only downside is the price, but you are paying a Dr that TRULY cares for your child and is in it for the long haul!  She has continued to research and conference with colleagues to find the right combination for my very complicated kid.",Female
"Life-changing in a positive way.  My Children have been seeing Dr Kotler for a couple of years now and it has made a huge difference in their anxiety and depression.  Other reviews here criticize her for thinking she knows patients better than the parents, etc.  Dr Kotler has been doing this for a long time and knows when something is up.  She will not spare your feelings and will give it to you straight.  Somethings are hard to hear and sometimes families are not ready to hear them.  I should know.  I am just glad that I swallowed my pride and focused on what is best for my children.  We are ALL better off for it. We will continue to see her for the foreseeable future (until she kicks us out bc my children are no longer children) as her help has improved our lives and likely saved the life of at least one of my children.",Female
"Dr. Kotler has been my Doctor and biggest advocate since I was 12 years old. I’m 19 now. She has always been there for me. She’s helped me through the most difficult times in my life. She even consulted with my boarding schools, wilderness programs, and other various doctors who I’ve seen over the years. I don’t know where I would be without her.",Female
"We were referred to Dr. Kotler by a friend after our son had been seen psychiatrists at Children’s Hospital, several psychologists, and even therapists. It wasn’t until we met with Dr. Kotler that our son’s diagnosis was fully understood. She was able to guide his care and treatment in a timely manner. She spends time with her patients and is available 24/7.",Female
Dr Kotler has treated my daughter as if she were her own. Always available. Follow up impeccable. Really cares about her patients. Goes above and beyond.,Female
"Dr. Kotler literally saved my sons life and I do not say that lightly. Her assessment, diagnosis, treatment and level of care is unparalleled to any other. She is the most dedicated Doctor we have ever seen. Highly recommend!",Female
Dr. Kotler has been our family physician. She is responsive to our needs and I have confidence in her. She is dedicated and determined to heal. We have relied on her for some very difficult health issues with one of my children and she has been a great caregiver and advocate.,Female
Dr Kotler is the only doctor that understands my child and his needs.  Both in and out of school.  My entire family thanks her as her advice and recommendations for care have brought our entire family back together.,Female
"I would NOT recommend Dr. Kotler. She asks leading questions, feels like she knows your child without even an introduction or an assessment, prescribes heavy medication after a 45 min visit, swears, and is very confident that she knows your child better than you do. STAY AWAY!!!",Female
She's awesome! I'm so glad I finally found a dr that doesn't act 'too good' to take on small tasks! That's what medicine is all about! From the moment I walked in I felt a good vibe! Really recommend her,Female
"Let me say this loud and clear, do NOT send your children to her. She is too confident in her diagnosis'. Absolutely horrible and NEVER calls back. ",Female
"My experience with the doctor was at South Jersey Pediatrics.  Dr. Kotler dismissed concerns I had with regard to my son having a reaction to a vaccine and instead proceeded to lecture me.  Also, every time I have had an appointment at South Jersey Pediatrics, the wait time is ridiculous... A minimum of an hour to hour and a half wait.  I will be changing doctors.  ",Female
I received excellent care as well as new medications that may help with my illness . The Doctor explained everything to my family in a manner that they understood. Great care.,Male

"I have been a patient of Dr. Kabell for many years and have found him consistently warm, interested, explanatory, and thorough. I highly recommend him.",Male
"I trust Dr. Kabell implicitly.  His well thought out judgement, knowledge, warmth and caring are always so reassuring.  He is patient and listens carefully.  His treatment recommendations are sound.  Uses most current testing methods and follows up promptly.  He has been my Dr. since 2006 and has provided the best of care ever since.",Male
"Excellent doctor! We are so pleased to have him as a doctor. He is compassionate, professional, and so kind. He has been very accurate with my husbands care and

"I would  highly recommend Dr. Kabemba, he is an excellent doctor and truely cares for each of his patients. Dr. Kabemba is the Medical Director for ANR Clinic and he treated me for my opioid addiction. He was very professional, compassionate, and attending to my needs.

"I had gastric by-pass surgery in 2012. Lost the weight- but then slowly went back to my old habits.When I found out I did not have to go back to Danville to see my Surgeon but could follow-up with Dr Otarod here in Scranton I was thrilled. Not only was Dr. Otarod not judgemental,she seemed to understand &amp; was ready to help me get back on track. I am now seeing her often- following up with the dietition on a  regular basis -changing what works and doesn't work for ME.",Female
He is a fantastic doctor with great smile and has an amazing friendly personality and very knowledgeable. He has helped me with my problem and provided great emotional support. Great doctor. Highly highly highly recommend.????,Male

"I had a mole removed in his Hudson, NY office on 7/11/19 and two days later had cellulitis and had to go to urgent care for antibiotics. I can only assume this occured during the procedure because I kept the area clean and covered post visit. Also, I was given no instructions of any kind regarding post-procedure wound care.  My call to his office the next day was not returned.",Male
Dr. Kabigting has been a godsend to me. I had horrible eczema and he encouraged me to try a new drug that has worked great. Anytime I need a follow up appointment or have to get in quickly to see him he always fits me into his schedule. Wait time is never more than 10 minutes. Would recommend him to every and anybody.,Male
"Dr. Kabigting (aka Dr. Fil) is, without a doubt, the best doctor I've ever had. In addition to his first-rate expertise and professionalism, Dr. Fil promptly, respectfully, and comprehensively addresses all of my concerns/questions, both in-person and over email. I was in a scheduling bind last summer, and he ALWAYS made time for me, which involved frequent and last-minute treatments that vastly improved my psoriasis. Thank you, Dr. Fil, for your endless commitment to my health! 5 stars!",Male
"I am pleased to have found Dr. Kabigting and am delighted to refer him to anyone in need of his services.

His attention to detail and awareness of my concerns were evident in his great bedside manner and his thorough follow up!

Dr Kabigting and his staff are very caring and helpful in explaining and providing solutions to my sons’ hair loss issues. I highly recommend the entire team and feel so lucky that we found them. ,Male
I cannot believe he is only in his 30s and practicing for ~8 years. Dr. Kabigting has the knowledge and professionalism that I have never seen in any other doctor. He is simply an amazing doctor.,Male
"Dr. Kabigting is a knowledgeable, patient doctor with a wonderful bedside manner. His whole staff is wonderful as well. After years of suffering from alopecia he finally helped find me a treatment that is working.",Male
I almost don't want to recommend because they his calendar will be full.  He was on point and through.  Dr. Kabigting is permanent in my contact list.  ,Male
"Excellent bedside manner, thorough but efficient! Would recommend whole heartedly",Male
"Clearly a smart guy but like others have said, he has never taken the time to listen to my concerns or explore options based on my medical history. I never saw him for more than 10 minutes. I came in for a hair loss issue and after a year of zero improvement, he assured me I looked better even though I’ve lost significantly more hair since I started seeing him. Rather than talk to me about it, he prescribed me a medication I was uncomfortable taking without doing the proper blood work first.",Male
I recommend Dr. Kabigting to everybody I know. Acne really took hit a hit to my confidence and thanks to him I can now wear no makeup with more confidence than I had WITH makeup before. I’ve been seeing him for over a year and drive very far to see him because he’s THAT worth it. He is absolute angel sent from the skin gods!!!!,Male
"I'm very happy with Dr. Fil, he is treating me for a rare skin condition in my scalp. I'd been dealing with ineffective treatments for this condition by 2 other dermatologists with no improvements for almost 10 years before I started seeing Dr. Fil late last year. He immediately diagnosed my problem and recommended a treatment; today after 7 months under Dr. Fil's care my scalp has already improved far beyond what the other dermatologists I saw in the past 10 years ever achieved.",Male
"Dr. Kabigting is hands down the BEST dermatologist I have ever had. I  have been suffering from acne since a very young age. Dr. Kabigting was referred to me by a friend who sees him as well and her skin has dramatically changed since she has been under his care, that made me want to try him. I work is very effective, and in moments of doubt Dr. Kabigting's words of encouragement to hang on and believe in the process are just soo up lifting. ",Male
"Hands down, the most patient-friendly, supportive, and informed MD I've seen in my life. ",Male
Dr. Fil is amazing! He really listened to my skin concerns and was super patient. He makes sure you understand your diagnosis and is super easy to talk to. He also is quick to get back to you with any questions you may have. I have referred multiple colleagues to him and they have all had more than satisfactory consultations with him.,Male
Dr. K goes above and beyond to make sure he is available to treat my skin issues and with my most recent visits has been able to tackle a nasty case of nummular eczema that got infected. Prescriptions have been ready at my pharmacy same day. Dr. K has been awesome. ,Male
"Dr. ""Fil"" Kabigting is fantastic. I was struggling with seborrheic dermatitis and the treatments prescribed by another dermatologist caused me to develop both rosacea and perioral dermatitis. Fed up, I went to see Dr. Fil, described the symptoms and treatments used before, and he came up with a good approach to get my skin back to normal. 

Additionally, Dr. Fil is genuinely kind and committed to helping his patients. He responds to emails very quickly.",Male
"Nicest office I have stepped foot in. Everything brand new.
Literally zero waiting time.
Dr Fil showed me HOPE and compassion with a condition (alopecia) that doctors have literally told me ""nothing I can do! get a wig!""
Dr. Fil has me on a breakthru medication that is working.
He and his team have taken much of their time writing appeals and pleas to my insurance company and pharm company to help me to afford the Rx.
This is the doctor and team I have been searching for for years! Thank You!!",Male
"Dr. Kabinoff is completely incompetent.  Nice bedside manner and staff but if you're looking for a doctor who will really look into making the right diagnosis and treatment plan based on clinical research, knowledge and history of his patients, he's not the guy.",Male

Thanks Dr. Kabinoff

"I was most impressed by the personalized care and attention I received.  Dr. Kabinoff does not have a team of medical assistants doing the work for him.  He is the only clinician you see when you visit his office.  He is thorough in his evaluation and listens to your concerns.  He does not order unnecessary services to ""bulk up the bill"" like I have experienced at other physician practices.  I would recommend Dr, Kabinoff to anyone.",Male

I have had two surgeries with Dr Kabins. The first in my neck to remove bone Spurs and carpal tunnel in my right hand. And a year later to repair nerve damage in my lower back a L4 to sacral 1 spinal fusion. I was in incredible pain before both surgeries. This man fixed them both. My throat doesn’t even have a visible scar. He is an amazingly caring man who will treat you like you are the only one in the hospital. The staff takes him very serious! His office visits will be at least 1-2 hr wait but I believe he was worth it.,Male
"Dr Kabins was for me an excellent doctor. I had 2 surgeries, 4 years apart, 1996 and 2000. Dr Kabins performed both of them. L5, S-1 and L4 the second time. Fusion both times and I was back to work in 3 months.  It has been 20 and 24 years since and I must say I have been pain free for the better part of 20 odd years. I never felt so well cared for as when Dr. Kabins cared for me.  I would recommend his totally.",Male
Dr. Kabis is an amazing provider who truly cares about his patients! I cant thank him enough for helping my daughter walk again!!,Male
"Dr. Kabins demonstrates excellent skills both in and out of the operating room.  He spends all the time you need explaining what is going on (this creates long wait times, but totally worth it).  You know you will get the best care with Dr. Kabins.  ",Male
"Dr Kabins did surgery on my wife on 2007. Spinal fusion C4,5,6, and 7. Anterior and posterior. Two surgeries scheduled within 2 weeks.  The Dr did the 2 surgeries within 3 days of each other. My wife, who was very healthy pre surgery, gets C Dif after first surgery. Dr Kabins proceeded with 2nd surgery 3 days later. My wife then is in MICU for about 8 months. She suffered renal failure. Respiratory failure, heart failure multiple times. She was intubated into a forced coma for the whole time.  She coded many times in those 8 months.  She finally was discharged after 10 months, only to be diagnosed with a brain tumor about a year later and passed away.  I found out she was deprived oxygen at some point during the second surgery. I had many reports from other orthopedic surgeons after her nightmare that concurred she was deprived oxygen, but none of those surgeons would back up what they told me in a court of law.  Dr kabins needs to be investigated for medical malpractice. I tried.",Male
Dr. Kabins perform surgery on my lower back . He fixed a previous surgery that went bad. He did a great job I feel a lot better thank you Dr. Kabins,Male
I have recently had extensive back surgery performed by Dr. Kabins. I never felt pressured into making a decision to have surgery and he spent as much time with me as I felt needed to answer all my questions. I found him to be very knowledgeable and caring. I am a nurse and yet let him take my life into his hands. I will never regret choosing him as a provider and will highly recommend him to others.,Male
Dr kabins is great at what he does. Yes you do have to wait but once you are in the back you will know why. He doesn’t push you out the door. He explains everything. I was in a car accident and needed c5-c-7 fused. I was so scared but he explained everything to my husband and my self and took such great care of me. I am a month today post op and he removed my bandage yesterday and I was shocked to see that there was hardly no scar. I would recommend him to anyone in a heart beat.,Male
I had to have emergency back surgery due to loss of control with bladder and bowel. I am so thankful that I met Dr. Kabins he is an EXCELLENT surgeon.

"Dr. Kabins is no doubt the best surgeon in Las Vegas. He has taken excellent care of me. There was a point that I thought I was never going to be pain free and with out issues. After my recent 3 level fusion, I'm back to a normal life. I feel 100% better and I'm only 5 weeks post op. I would recommend Dr. Kabins to anyone.

Best surgeon in Nevada! I have had neck and back surgery after an accident. He gave me back the use of my legs. I will forever be grateful for him and his amazing hands! ",Male
Very very detail oriented. He takes ample time with each patient and isn't in a rush to get to the next patient. He tends to run behind a good hour and a half but the wait is well worth it when it's your turn. As a  patient I've had a low back fusion surgery and a spinal stimulator implant. Dr Kabins is the Best ortho surgeon in Vegas. His techniques had given me minimal scaring and optimal reduced recovery times. Before having surgery he is a must go to even for a second opinion. ,Male

It says right on Mayoclinic.org that this medication is for schizophrenia (which my mom does not have) and also that ""This medicine should not be used to treat behavioral problems in older adults who have dementia.""   Guess what---my mom is 94 years old AND has dementia and Kabir was giving her this medication.    This is negligience in the extreme and he is a TERRIBLE doctor.   Wish I could give him a negative review.",Male
Stop lying about the wait time!! Everytime I come here I’m waiting for an hour or longer.  Today I’ve been in the waiting room for over 80 minutes!  I haven’t even gone back to a room yet to wait for another 15-20 min... I don’t understand why your office is always over booking patients.  This is the worst doctors experience I have ever had... not once or twice but every time I’m come here I’m waiting forever.  All the reviews are the same. 5 min appointment with a 90 minute wait time.  Horrible,Male

My first scheduled appointment with Dr. Kabir, I learned that my insurance was not accepted, so we rescheduled as I made changes with my insurance carrier to that which they accept.

I checked reviews and feedback from her patients. I made the right choice in choosing Dr.  Kabir. She is in tune to my needs, pain, and flares.

A very kind and caring lady that treats me with great care.",Female
"Dr. Kabir has been extremely helpful with the treatment of my RA and other auto-immune conditions. Since she does not have a patient overload, there are not any long waits, and that is very good for those of us who cannot sit for long periods. She is very cautious about the possibility of liver and kidney damage with the use of biologics, so she requires regular bloodwork and office visits. My only complaint is that she does not have a lab technician. Bloodwork elsewhere is inconvenient. Alice K",Female
I've been seeing Dr. Kabir for a few years now and I'm always satisfied. She always ask questions to help her understand my need and she's a step ahead at making sure I have my medications. ,Female
Dr. Kabir has been very attentive to my treatment. She has seen me on short notice when necessary and keeps up with the latest research on my disease.,Female
"Completely dissatisfied w/ experiences here. Biggest problem is communication. Almost impossible to get into contact with them about prescriptions and questions; you leave a message, but they never get back to you, you have to keep calling until someone answers. I take an important medicine and they must approve it often, but you have to keep calling just to get them to do that, and of course, you must keep calling to get an answer. Would not recommend as I felt like my problems were not valued.",Female
"I've seen Dr. Kabir for all types of reasons and he's never disappointed me with his knowledge, understanding &amp; personal touch to each and every appointment.

Even though I've moved, I still keep going back! ??",Male

"Takes his time and listens!! Is not too quick prescribe antibiotics, unless necessary, which I appreciate!",Male
Bad! never go back again. Just take money no treatment. He did not listen to my symptoms ignore me all the time. his office staff always rude to me and other patients. I wish I had just return and did not go through his office visits. I had HMO and I was sick on that day so I had no choice. His office staff lied about putting a referral to ophthalmologist reality when i check with my insurance they never received any request. Never use this doctor again!,Male
He is so kind and answers all questins,Male

Besides doctor Kabir being a little fast when he works he has been an amazing doctor I highly recommend him to everyone he might not have much emotions but he cares more about your health then being blunt And ur feelings  he is amazing and has saved 2 of my kids life and my own I will travel the world to make sure I only have him delivering my babies and my Obgyn his nurses are amazing and so is his second hand lady who is there with him at all times,Male

"Dr. Kabir is the worst doctor I've ever seen in my life. I do not recommend him for anything. He was very careless during my hysterectomy, severing my ureter while removing my ovaries. This injury was left unattended to until I was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance with urine leaking in my body. i had to have several other surgeries including an apendectomy, a nephrostomy tube in my kidney, and ureter re-attachment. Several years later I'm still having issues from one careless cut from Dr. Kabir.",Male

"Poor bedside manner and lack of intelligent treatment. He prescribed my wife Zofran as a first resort, not as a last resort. Zofran has been linked to birth defects as high as 1/4 children born from mothers who took it for nausea. This guy is a puppet of big pharma and if you call him out on it he and his staff become beligerent and condescending. We will never see him again and I will post this on every forum I can find due to the way he and his staff have mistreated us.",Male
"Had concerns of conflicting bloodwork results between my GP and Kabir. His practice handled my concern unprofessionally and his staff and himself contradicted one another. Attempting to discuss it directly with him made him raise his voice and respond inappropriately. He cast blame to my phone carrier because I did not get any notice that my results needed attention - no other follow up. Computers are left open while waiting (HIPPA violation?)

"Dr Kabir delivered 2 of my children and I will always love him.  He has the best bedside manner he is thorough and more importantly, he listens and takes every patient's concern seriously.  I have sent 2 of my best friends to him and he has delivered all of their babies as well.  I sent my mother when she had a cervical cancer scare and he performed surgery on her successfully.  I also sent my cousin to him with many of the same concerns that my mom had and he was able to help her as well.",Male
"Great experience wit Dr. Kabir. He delivered 3 of my children an  I am thankful for that.He does not rush to do unnecessary  c-sections. Busy but nice and does his job perfectly.I would recommend Dr. Kabir to anyone...

2014 Veteans Patient I was asked to find an out of network OB/GYN since the VA hospital does not have OB/GYN's athe women's pavilion. The wrist mistake of my life was trusting this OB/GYN and staff. I called to see if they would agree to accept VA ccoverage which they agreed to then after being seen declined after my second visit stating the VA does not pay which they did.At   Methodist Dr. Kabir refuse to treat me while going through early signs of labor. My son was birth early an denied care.,Male
"I always recommend Dr. Kabir.
Unfortunately I am having to change doctors right now due to change of insurance. I am sad to be leaving from his care.
Him and his first nurse are my favorite people. They took care of me when I was pregnant, and delivery was amazing with him. First nurse doesn't sugar coat anything, if you need to do something that is in needed care of you and your baby, she'll tell ya. I'm always taken care of here and definitely recommend Dr Kabir!",Male
"I feel really happy with Dr Kabir attention, my son is 8 years old and he save his life and also help my sister too with her pregnancy she had a 12 month baby girl right now. And I have my children with Dr Kabir's sister, she is a wonderful Pediatrician Dr Ifdekar Unissa .",Male
"I love the attention they provided me throughout my pregnancy very attentive and knowledgeable love Dr. Kabir. When I went into labor the attention was incredible Dr. Kabir was checking on me every minute when time to deliver he was there providing all the help unfortunately had to have an emergency Csection but, even that was very good I have been recovering very fast and well, I will recommend Dr. Kabir to anyone. ",Male
"Very attentive and knowledgeable, makes you feel comfortable! Wonderful staff!",Male
Scheduled an appointment 2 weeks ago. Husband took off to go with me.They call 15 min prior to the appointment to tell me they are not in network with my insurance so they can't see me. Unbelievable and totally unprofessional. Glad I found out before I trusted them with my health!,Male
"Don't trust this doctor.....he wanted to send my mom to  six months of therapy for vertigo of the ear after she fell and split her head open.  I explained to him that based on her symptoms I thought it was a thyroid issue and he said ""there is nothing wrong with her thyroid"".  So I asked him to show me the testing  data that supported his claim.  He became very defensive and condescendingly stated ""just because you research online doesn't make you a doctor"" ....never claimed it did!!!  However I'm an informed daughter trying to help my mother.  He only performed half the test and made the diagnosis.    I demanded that he send us to an endocrinologist.   The endocrinologist  touched my mom's throat and said she had a huge mass. A biopsy showed that it was THYROID CANCER.   Had we listened this would have cost her her life!!!  If I could give him ZERO stars I would!",Male
My wife and I trust Dr O’Brien completely. He is very personable and competent and his staff is great.,Male
Dr O'Brien is a great Dr. Me and my children go there he is also my parents Dr. I love how when he comes in the exam room he will take a chair and sit down and explain everything to you he will also draw it out for you and give you some reading material  if you needed  I highly recommend him,Male
Very good doctor. Dr O and staff are very professional and best care that I have ever received ,Male
"If I could give him a zero,star I would!, He misdiagnosed my cancer and had I listened to him....I would be dead!!  Avoid this Dr at al, cost if you value your life!! ",Male
He was my doctor for years with no issues at all. I moved and had forgot about one appointment. 2 days after I had missed my appointment I called and rescheduled thinking everything was fine. The next day after rescheduling I got a notice in the mail saying he dismissed me due to no call no show. Completely outrageous in my opinion.,Male
"The worst dr. I have ever seen. Poor patient attitude. Doesn't appear to be listening or believing the patient. Several occasions of cold responses and lack of caring about overall health. Yesterday,  he refused to refill a needed prescription so I spent 5 hours in an ER because of my anxiety disorder even though I have an appt with him as soon as they could place me on the schedule. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.",Male
Horrible service and complete lack of caring by staff. My family of 6 are going somewhere else.,Male
Dr. O'Brien is a very good Dr. However his staff is rude not only on the phone but also in person. ,Male
"Great doctor! 
I completely trust him. Very sincere and knowledgeable. ",Male
Very poor service and slow responding to my care. Really made my treatment inconvenient. Put me 3 weeks behind trying to fix my knee issue have to go to another Doctor. Would not recommend. And had the audacity to send me a bill.,Male
"He is very responsive and listens to you.  
Works with me  and friendly doctor",Male
"Listens to what I have to say, easy to talk to. You don't feel rushed during the visit. Very caring and covers all my concerns . ",Male
"Dr O'Brien is a very competent, personable doctor who is easy to understand when he explains complicated medical treatments.",Male
"This provider has, in the past, called me and left a message. When returning the call, I noticed a charge on my next bill. No problem--just inform up front! Billing issues have happened several times, however, and the irony is that an area of healthcare where one might expect a bit of compassion, the front desk staff are just not, for the most part, very nice people. I noticed staff comments in another review, too, and you will get nickle and dimed for anything. I understand fair and reasonable charges, but there have been several occasions where I was charged for something I didn't expect. I have no problem paying any bill--just disclose it up front that ""you're on the clock."" For as good of a doctor as he is, this erodes some of the very trust that is paramount to a therapeutic partnership.",Male
"Dr. L'ecuyer takes the time to evaluate what you are saying and what you are experiencing.  His attentiveness is a strong characteristic, and I have found this to be quite helpful.  Further, he is quite experienced with medications and their strengths and weaknesses, how they will affect your mood, and the long-term outcome of each drug.  Again, I have found his expertise in this area to be quite strong. Overall, he is an excellent psychiatrist.",Male
He is very caring and knowledgable . He will work with you to schedule you as is best for you. He has helped me tremendously and I am  not an eay patient.,Male
"Best mental health provider in the KC metro! He is wonderful with children and adults. My whole family loves him. We are forever grateful. It isn't often that he has openings for new patients, get in quick!
His Office Manager/Accounts Receivable (blonde) lady is a beast. If you miss and/or are late to one or two appointments, she will FIRE you as a patient...even if you call to reschedule and pay the $90 missed appt. fee(s)!!!  The other two office ladies (brunette and redhead) are wonderful!",Male
Fantastic doctor he genuinely cares about his patients. He cared for my mom and now me and soon my daughter is going to be seeing him.  You can’t find a better or more knowledgeable doctor. Also if you need a referral to another doctor he ONLY SENDS YOU TO THE BEST!!! That’s how FANTASTIC A DOCTOR HE IS!!!,Male
"He has the worst bedside manner of any doctor I've ever been to.  Seems distant and uninterested, like many of the other reviews stated.",Male
"Dr. L'Ecuyer has been my gp for close to 20 years, and he is terrific! He takes as much time as I need, asks and answers questions to be sure that everything is covered.  He runs pretty much on time...I will be called back within about 5 minutes, and he will show up in the examining room within 10 minutes after that.  He is super respectful and compassionate.  I can't say enough good things, and I highly recommend him.",Male
Terrible. Heartless and cold man. Seemed very distant.,Male
Dr. Lecuyer has been my primary physician for over 20 years. He's amazing! He is an expert in his field and he LISTENS. Excellent doctor!!!,Male
Dr. Lecuyer is one of the worst doctors I have ever seen.,Male
"I highly recommend Dr. L’Ecuyer. He is thorough and does not rush visits. He answers questions, is  compassionate and provides excellent care. ",Male
I was a little nervous about establishing myself as a new patient with a doctor after almost 40 years with my previous MD.  Dr. L'Ecuyer was very professional and engaging.  He spent almost 40 minutes with me on my first visit and followed up on every question I had.  Excellent physician.,Male
"Spends plenty of time and listens to my concerns. Worked on dealing with my issues, one at a time. Highly recommend him.",Male
"Condescending and heartless, Dr. L'Ecuyer has the narcissistic qualities of a surgeon.  He will make you feel like a 2-yr-old who is wasting his time. He doesn't listen and has zero compassion. He sends you for tests you don't need, schedules unnecessary surgeries, and is too quick to hand out medications. His staff is top notch, and I feel sorry for every one of them who works under him. Carlotta, his P.A., is much more thorough and kind, and you are lucky to get her instead of him.",Male
"Dr L'Ecuyer is a suburb Dr.  Listens, check, advises, and recommend top docs. 
He ""takes care of me!""
He is my GP
I have referred him to several family and friends and they still go.",Male
"I was told to tolerate his not so nice bedside manor, as he was a good doctor. After MANY years under his care, I have given up. He is dismissive and does not seem to care about my welfare.  If seeing this practice, I can only recommend Carlotta. She is the NP there and DOES listen and care",Male
He sits at lap top typing 95% of the time and seems do connected with the patient. He will ask the same questions several time and will not remember you from the last time you were there. He has ver little direct eye contact and no time to listen.I felt like it was a wast of time and won't go back. He appears not to be interested or caring and a return phone or follow up won't happen. I do not recommend.,Male
"Doesn't listen, most of the brief appointment was with his back to me while he typed. Wasn't interested in my main concerns, and then put things in my chart that aren't true and things we did not discuss. Office said they'd remove these items, but did not.",Male
"Dr. L'Ecuyer seems to be a good doctor, but the office is very disorganized. When you call for any reason you never get the same receptionist or nurse. I have spoken to four different people in the last two weeks; the right hand never knows what the left is doing. One of the PA's is behind in her charting, a mental acuity test given to my mom over a month ago is still not in her chart! Desks, workstations, and the lab are all cluttered. Takes up to 48 hours for a call to be returned.",Male
"Dr. L'Ecuyer is great.  He's been my doctor for about 10 years.  I've had many different illnesses through that time, nothing serious, but they have been diverse.  He is very thorough in his questions and diagnoses.  He runs tests, and he refers you to a specialist when he feels it is necessary.  And he has a great bedside manner.  I love him and recommend him to anyone who is looking for a doc or who complains about their own doctor.  The wait in the office to see him is not bad at all.",Male
"She helped our daughter who had been suffering from chronic pain.  She taught her how to regulate her emotions and take control of the pain.  Thanks to Dr. L'ecuyer, she now is in control, and not the pain.",Female
This Doctor made me very uncomfortable. Her questioning was harsh. I never wanted to see her again. I found a Psychiatrist that is the opposite of her personality and my care and progress has been amazing.,Female
My dghtr shld hv been seen evry 3 mnths it's been a  year! so I had my primary care doctor call to schedule an appointment he was obviously angry and was very rude. He made  remarks in front of my daughter  about her disease was progressive we have discussed this previously that this would be said only to myself and that I would Explain that to my child but in his anger he said it in front of her.when I told him it upset me he super call me to refuse fut. trtmnt evn thgh desprtly nd vindictive,Male
"Dr L’Esperance saved my husbands eye sight throughout his lifetime until Joe lost his battle with Juvenile Diabetes in 1995. He always told Joe, “I won’t let you go blind.”  That was Joe’s biggest fear.  I will always be grateful to doctor L’esperance.",Male
"I am a terrible patient. I challenge doctors and their staff. I have an outsized suspicion of the medical establishment. And I take it out one them. 
I avoid doctors, however, sometimes it can't be avoided. Such as with kidney stones. 
Several times I was intemperate with Dr. L'Esperance. But he never never retaliated. He was patient with me and somehow knew that I was either frightened or frustrated and didn't take it personally. I am grateful. 
Dr. L’Esperance exceeded my expectation. He is a strong communicator and caring doctor. I hope he will continue to have me as a patient. ",Male
Great Dr!  Handled my prostate surgery perfectly.  Very down to earth explaining procedures.  Highly recommended.,Male

My husband had prostrate surgery by Dr L’Esperance- it was perfect - Dr Jim is professional- upfront - an expert in his field - and an excellent surgeon.

Really cool and easy experience. ,Male

"Dr. L""Esprance:  I was diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer and he performed a neobladder on me at the Naval Hospital in San Diego.  That was done on October 2008 it has been 10 years since that operation and I am doing just fine.  He did a great surgery, and if you don't want to use a catheter and wear a urine bag taped to your leg he is the man to see.  Thanks Dr. L'Esprance, I have returned back to normal since that surgery.

I have been going to Dr L'Esperance for a little over a year and I can say with certainty that his care is the best. He makes sure you understand exactly what's going on . I highly recommend him and this facility to anyone...,Male
Dr. Temperance performed a robotic prostatectomy on me. Surgery was short with minimal pain and discomfort. I would recommend him to others needing this procedure. Very pleased.,Male
"Dr L'Esperance has been my Oncologist for the past 6 years. As an in remission cancer patients due to his knowledge of Prostate Cancer and its effects, he and his team were able to remove my cancerous prostate and spared as much of my nerves in the area of the prostate as possible. I have and i would in the future recommend him and his staff.",Male
"This guy is a jerk, I was expecting an sp cath placement and he did a dilation of my bladder neck. He didn't tell what he was going to do he just did it. And no anesthesia by the way at one point I was literally begging him to stop, he just kept going. Arrogant would be the short side of this guy. Avoid him at all cost.",Male
He is amazing!  Quick and precise!!,Male
dr. l'europa stuck his head in for about 2 minutes after explaining my symptoms to his practitioner and suggested another specialist. a complete waste of time.,Male
I have had a very positive experience with Dr. L'Europa and his staff. They have navigated through all of the insurance red tape for me to receive my medications and treatments. He and his staff are always very kind to me.,Male
"If I could put no stars I would. He is rude and wouldn't shake my hand when I extended mine to his, didn't even acknowledge my wife and missed diagnosed me. Without even doing an MRI he diagnosed me with Idiopathic neuropathy and said nothing could be done, it would only get worse as time passes. Got a second opinion and this doctor did an MRI plus all kinds of tests on me. When he got the results back he sent me to a surgeon who did both Cat Scan and MRI and found I had a narrow spine and that bones were touching nerves that were making me walk unsteady and cause weakness and numbing in my fingers, Spinal Stenosis. He operated on me in October and I am in therapy, walking better and improving every day. I am so happy I didn't listen to Dr. L' Europe's diagnosis and got a second opinion.",Male
"Nothing like being told you have a tumor on your brain (not a clue this was coming since MRI was for concussion), the day before Thanksgiving, not knowing this man who obviously made many incorrect assumptions about me without checking my file or asking me, not allowing questions or corrections nor time for anything and here I am 11 days later with none of the follow up from neurosurgeon or with other issue of concussion that was promised having been done. Thanks. Merry freakin Christmas I think. What do I know?  I’m brain injured-have been since 9/1/19...",Male
"Went to my appointment this morning, after taking time off from work and waiting almost 9 weeks. I was told after waiting all of this time that I needed to be pre-approved by my primary care. The receptionist stated she left 3 phone messages over the past 3 days at my home regarding my needing this pre-approval. The only message I received was a confirmation of my appointment. When I arrived home after work, there was message the receptionist left THE SAME TIME AS MY APPOINTMENT stating I needed the pre-approval! While I was at the desk, she insisted that she called my primary care physician and received no response. The doctor she called had died 3 years ago!! I was then told that another doctor had been called and they did not receive a response from his office. His office told me they never received any communication from L'Europa's office at any time. They then blamed me for the mix-up?? They should have apologized, kept my appointment and worked this out.  They chose to lie.",Male
Had a exam with Dr. L'Europa for migraines and mostly spoke with his nurse/clinical assistant who was very nice BUT NOT A NEUROLOGIST. ,Male
Should have license revoked,Male
"I had my first appointment with Dr.L'Europe today.

I found Dr. L'Europe friendly taking his time with me.

"After many years of suffering, practically daily, with Migraine headaches, my doctor recommended I see a Neurologist, specifically  Dr L'Europa. Under his care, and the care of the Nurses and Practitioners I am feeling much better. In the last three months I have been able to work, make plans, and keep promises; things I lost out on for so many years due to the debilitating pain of my migraines and chronic nausea. I am thankful, and confident in my future care with Dr. L'Europa and his staff. ",Male
"Dr is arrogant and dismissive. He uses his NPs to do the work and the runs in the room for a minute and provides his ""expert"" opinion. Once he has tried ""everything"" he sends you away to another MD, formally severing your relationship. This is after spending very little time with you. He will let you leave in clear distress, in a state where you should clearly not drive. This is not patient care. An MD should do everything to help a patient get well not the minimum. Off to the ER for help.....",Male
"When I saw Dr L'Europa for the first time, he was in the room with me for all of 30 seconds. To me, that doesn't feel like a significant amount of time to diagnose a neurological issue. His nurse practitioners seemed very professional and knowledgeable, but we're not representative of Dr L'Europa himself. Find yourself a doctor that takes the time to listen, not a practice that follows the same routine for everyone that walks through the door, hoping it sticks.",Male
Horrible. He was dismissive and sent me to another neurologist. Even though I have a diagnosis of MS. He told me that was inaccurate because I could walk. Do not go to this doctor.,Male
"Dr.L'europa is not concerned with patients' issues.  He is not responsive to questions, treatment options, or the overall well being of his patients.    ",Male

" I have begged for help only to hear ""sorry nothing we can do for you"" this is a typical response when you have FBSS. Dr L'Heureaux has given me HOPE because he CARES he's not just looking to cut on people he takes time with you he probably saved my life just by CARING and listening to me. I feel finally that I am in the BEST HANDS. Too many dr's these days in medicine to make money and forget about ethics/oaths and trying to help the sick. They forget we're PEOPLE not Dr. L'HEUREAUX. ",Male
"Dr.Leureux  performed neck surgery on me in 2003.  Excellent results.  When I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis,  I went to see Dr. L'Heureux. ( I would not let anyone else perform surgery on me in case I needed surgery)  Well  surgery was done in February.  The fusion and everything else he did, was a great success-
until I fell and broke a vertebrae.  We are still dealing with that but the Dr. has been great!!!!!",Male

And I continue to do very well I would recommend him to everybody!",Male

He explained his thoughts and the procedure he recommended in terms that were easy to understand. He took the time to answer questions. My results were amazing and I had immediate relief from pain that had limited my life for almost a year.  I highly recommend Dr. La Bore and his team. ,Male
"Very hard to reach the staff. I called several times but Anoush and Linette kept putting me
on hold. Also very hard to get an
appointment even with insurance pre authorization. ",Male
I have called multiple times and no one answers the phone.  I have left voice messages with my phone number but no one calls me back.  I have been waiting over a month just for them to call me back.  Luckily 911 works in case of emergencies.  Do not expect to reach anyone from this office because you will die before they get back to you.,Male
"This review is for the administrative office. My surgent referred me to see Dr.La after an orthopedic surgery. I called to make an appointment, they asked for my insurance ID, I got an appointment in 2 month. I called at least 3 times more to see if somebody cancelled as I was in pain. Finally after 2 month I came to see Dr.La, filled out all the papers in the office only to discover Dr.La does not take my insurance (PPO Blue Shield)! All this time waisted! They knew what my ins was frombeginnin",Male
"Dr. La is one of these hard to find physicians who are not only knowledgeable but also extremely caring. I suffer from a couple of autoimmune conditions and Dr. La has been a blessing to have as my rheumatologist. Not only does he help me manage my conditions, but when I got really sick and had to be admitted to the hospital, he came in every day to check on my condition and worked tirelessly with other physicians to get me back on me feet. I give Dr. La the highest recommendation possible.",Male
Dr. La and his associate Jessica St. Jules are outstanding. They are both very knowledgeable and attentive. I highly recommend either one of them in the practice. Wait times ,Male
"Office is chaotic and frustrating.  Oftentimes, can't get through and are told to leave a voicemail.  Requests left on the voicemail will not be addressed.  Othertimes, are put on hold and then disconnected.  Sometimes are dealt with in a dismissive manner. I was bringing my disabled wife in for an appointment but was told not until a prescribed procedure had been performed.  She ran out of a pain medicine.  When called for a refill, was told not until he sees her again in a month. Withdrawals ",Male
I went to see this doctor because I was frustrated as my doctor of 15 years always seem to treat me like a number and not a person. Dr. La Follette  was incredible and took time and listened.  I felt like I was her only patient that day and she save the day.,Female
"I just had an appointment with Dr. LaFollette about a number of menopausal symptoms. She had a pocketful of solutions, research and references for me to read, assurances based on her own and her patients experiences. I found her to be a smart, positive, we-can-fix-that kinda woman.",Female
Seemed distracted and somehow disinterested. We found another doctor.,Male
Never available.  Never returns calls. First meeting he said he will do the bare minimum and he means it. He needs to get a job where caring for or about others is not a requirement.,Male
"Unprofessional office run by nasty people.
 The 1st time we scheduled a visit, the front desk person called us 2 hours before the visit, (we were at a different Dt's exam room), and demanded that we come 2 hours earlier, because the doctor was ""under the weather"" and wanted  ""to go home early"". We declined, because we could not make it and also because we did not want to see a doctor, who was ill. The employee did not hide her displeasure. When we came for a rescheduled visit (received multiple phone and text reminders), and started filling out the forms, we were told: ""We won't see you, because we do not accept Iowa Total care. They do not pay!"" During both scheduling events, this office had confirmed that they did accept that insurance. A follow-up call to IA Total Care  confirmed that LaFontant was indeed contracting with them, when he turned us away at the door after we made a 70-mile RT to see him. What a way to get back at a patient ! Do not recommend this place.",Male
Outstanding service and doctor - I have been with Dr. La Fontant for over 10 years and I consider it a blessing that he is my foot doctor.  I would and have continued to recommend him to others,Male
"Dr. La Gamma is a wonderful doctor/surgeon!!  I had a large polyp in my colon that could not be removed entirely during a colonoscopy.  I went to see Dr. La Gamma the very next day and within two weeks I was having surgery.  He answered all of my questions thoroughly.  Dr. La Gamma was knowledgeable and compassionate.  Dr. La Gamma performed a laparoscopic anterior resection on me.  The very next day he came to see me twice in the hospital.  His team was wonderful and the women in the office were also very caring and helpful.  At my follow up appointment, Dr. La Gamma removed my staples and explained that I had stage 1 colon cancer.  Wow!!!  Was I in shock!!!!  I’m extremely anxious to begin with and Dr. La Gamma noticed that right from the onset.  He knew how to reassure me that things are and will be ok.  He took my husband and I back to his office and spoke to us for quite some time.  If you need a colorectal doctor/surgeon, see Dr. La Gamma.  You will be in great hands with him!!!",Male
5 star experience from beginning to end!The office staff are helpful and attentive on the phone and in the office.I had my first Colonoscopy with Dr. LaGamma in December.He made me feel comfortable and was attentive.I had  to have a surgery in April and not only was he great about explaining what needed to be corrected in detail (that I could understand) he also was very thorough about what I should expect from my hospital stay and recovery. An excellent surgeon with a great bedside manner!,Male
Dr. LaGreca was the most professional and knowledgeable endocrinologist that I have seen.  She was very attentive and patient.  She helped me attain a normal thyroid level after a scary episode involving Graves opthalmopathy.,Female
"Dr. LaGreca and her staff are nice but she did not listen to me when I told her lowering my dosage of thyroid meds made me feel terrible. I was falling asleep whenever I sat down, I was cold, my nails became brittle, my hair lost its body, I couldn’t lose weight, I began to have hot flashes...all classic low thyroid symptoms. She said she wanted to lower them even further because my numbers had not come down enough. She cares more about the numbers than how I felt.",Female
By far the most experienced and thorough endocrinologist I have ever had! ,Female
"I have even a patient for many years.  Dr Lakier has always been helpful, knowledgeable, and caring.  ",Male
I have already  referred friends and also family. He is what a true family practice dr should be. He listens and follows up to make sure you are ok. He sees that you go to the proper specialists when necessary. HE GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND and you do not feel like just another body.,Male
Dr. La Luna is thorough and personable.  I never feel rushed and he answers all my questions. ,Male
"I saw dr Mike la on 5-14-2016 for debilitating back spasms at urgent care in Santa Monica. The minute he walked into the exam room, he started to size me up. Even before I could explain to him the pain I was in, he interrupted me by saying I can't give you anything for pain He must have said that  a dozen times. I thought he would order an ex Ray or urine sample. Something other than I can't give you any pain medication. I will not recommend him to my worst enemy.",Male
"very rude guy.  Insisted that my daughter doesnt have step. When the test turned out positive he had an attitude, sent prescription to the Pharmacy and stormed our of th
",Male
The best doctor. Took great care of me during a dangerous high risk pregnancy and other health issues. Can’t say enough about him! Good person and great doctor!,Male
"Dr. Lamonica cared for me through all 3 of my pregnancies. He was honest, realistic, gentle and kind. He listened. He answered my questions, my husband's questions and, during our last pregnancy, even my 2 and 4 year olds' questions. He is a good doctor and a good person. I would give him 10,000 stars if I could.",Male
1990,Male
"I was shocked at how unprofessional and rude Dr. La Motta was considering his profession and the fact that he is Cooper affiliated. He is judgemental. I felt skeeved out before, after, and during the short exam. Also I told him I'd have my retired doctor's office send over my history/papers and he told me that it's not necessary, that it didn't matter for him to have my OBGYN medical history. I'd have to disagree. Currently looking for a new doctor, a professional one. ",Male
He talked down to me because I was a teen mom then was so much in a rush to get my c-section done he didn't wait till I was numb enough which sent me into extreme shock and he cut my baby's face open during it! Never would see that man again!!,Male
"Dr. La Muraglia is one of the most attentive and caring doctors I have ever been in contact with. He listens, takes time to get to know his patients, and has a great sense of humor. If you’re making an appointment with him, you can be sure you’re in good hands. 

I had a peripheral artery disease and had to undergo a surgery a couple years ago. Dr. La Muraglia is a miracle worker because I’m glad to report that it’s been great ever since. I can jog for miles without any pain. I’m forever grateful to you doctor for everything you did!",Male
"We are so fortunate to have such a great vascular surgeon as Dr. LaMuraglia in our area !
Thank You Dr. LaMuraglia, your worth the wait !",Male
"Dr. LaMuraglia is one in a million! He is all business - which is to say he may not have the best beside manner, but then I do not see him for that. I see him for his superior medical skills. 

I have used his services over the course of 10 years with at least 7 surgeries during this time. I would not be alive today if not for his dexterity. 

Yes, there may be a ""longer than expected"" wait time in the Boston office, but then you may be the next one he spends extra time examining!",Male
"Arrogant, condescending, absolutely NO bedside manner.  I needed a clearance from cardiologist (his only) was going to call in favors to get me urgent appt.  Staff never followed up even after me calling several times. ",Male
Dr. LaNasa did my first rhinoplasty surgery 27 years ago when I had been assaulted and had a broken nose and a split lip.  I was only 17 and very scared.  He did a great job and kept me calm with a matter of fact approach. Over the years he has done 2 more surgeries when I had some sinus issues.  He has worked on my father and now I am taking my son to see him.  I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone that needs sinus and/or reconstructive help.,Male
"Unsuccessfully did my daughter's rhinoplasty. Is very very rude and demeaning. Always says that he and a ""doctor friend in New Orleans"" are the only ones who can do rhinoplasty. Cannot get in touch with him if emergency bc he said he can't answer his cell phone after hours.  After one year, I have to get my daughter's rhinoplasty corrected because LaNasa didn't secure the tip. It is literally starting to fall downward. I should've seen this when there were no patients in his office except for us",Male
Absolutely the best doctor I’ve ever had.,Male
Dr LaPietra was very informative on my choices in the future.  His bedside manner was excellent and I would recommend him to my family  and friends.,Male

Very friendly and easy to speak with ,Male

How aggravating.",Female
"I was a patient of Dr. La Scola in 2010 for removal of the prostate due to cancer. I was her first Da Vinci patient and the surgery went extremely well.

Would I go back to her for other Urology related problems?  You bet.",Female
"Dr. La was the first podiatrist out of many I saw to show compassion and listen to me. He was the first to order an MRI and help me with my accessory navicular.

I highly recommend her. ",Female

I had breast reduction and I appreciate so much that I had her as my surgeon.",Female
"I had accessory breast tissue removed. Dr La Via was referred to me by my breast surgeon Maggie DiNomie who I originally saw in regards to this tissue. Dr DiNomie recommended Dr La Via for the best cosmetic result with better scar placement .

Dr. L is truly a blessing.  I first came to him a couple years ago for some chronic neck pain after a car accident.  Recently I hurt my back lifting some boxes and had been off work because of it. My regular doctor shot me with steroids and gave me pain pills with the only effect being masked  pain relief.  I decided to revisit Dr L for this problem and with in 4 weeks I returned back to work.  His intuitive healing approach to my problem has been nothing short of miraculous. Thanks Dr L,Male
"Very knowledgeable and thorough.   After looking for answers with my regular PCP and falling on deaf ears, Dr. LaBeau  reviewed my medical history, explained the lab testing that he would like to run and why.

Buddy &amp; Jane Gallagher",Male
Released medical records without my permission.,Male
He made a bad impression one in every way. It seems very important to him to keep the patient in the dark. He wanted me to know nothing. It is my opinion that he does that because his department is the worst in a substandard hospital. the make a lot of mistakes and try to cover them up. It was the worst medical care I have ever had.,Male
Friendly man. Always willing to help you with other health issues you may have. ,Male
"My wife and I both went to see Dr. La Cava on separate occasions and we would not recommend this doctor.  He told my wife after two pregnancies with twins that she doesn't have anything wrong and she just needs to do more SIT UPS.

He told me that I didn't have any hormone issues yet three other doctors all diagnosed me with adrenal and testosterone and other disorders.  He and his associates are horrible!",Male
"Overall is interested in providing care and is focused on helping you manage diabetes better.  Not condescending and discusses goals that make sense offering support and help.  Access to him is good except first appointment.  Could be better about follow up, leaves voice mail but would be better to get time on calendar to talk.  He's as busy as I am, I'm not waiting by the phone either.  No reason for phone tag.  ",Male

"I had appointments and total knee replacement surgery in Nov 2020 at the Pickerington location.  Surgery was a success, but overall experience with the facility was disappointing and extremely frustrating. The scheduling staff was inefficient and unorganized.  Numerous confirmations for my appointments were received, but on 2 occasions when I arrived at the office for those appointments I would be told Dr. Ladu was not in the office, that he was working at another location. My travel time was well over an hour, with one visit involving travel through counties with a Level 2 Snow Emergency.
Another issue-Surgery was 1 week before Thanksgiving. I was not given enough pain medication to get me through the holiday weekend, the office was closed and I was unable to get meds until the following Monday night. Not a pleasant experience.

All of my expectations were not only met but exceeded.  Dr. LaFleur is a highly skilled surgeon with a light and gentle touch. She is a perfectionist who achieves the goals she sets out for. In short she's the best.",Female
"Dr. LaFontaine has treated me for kidney stones and was very good. Surgery was successful, and he was very empathetic to my pain. Now years later, he is treating my husband Jim for bladder cancer. Great bedside manner, and my husband really likes him. Definitely 5 stars ??",Male
Direct and to the point! Extremely efficient and took the time to explain my condition and treatment options available. When testing and a procedure had to be scheduled his office was prompt and communicated with me throughout the entire process. Highly recommend Dr. LaFontaine!,Male
"I saw Dr Lafontaine in 2014 and was having chronic cystitis and pubic pain. When I saw him he told me ""I do not know why I you're having symptoms, it could be because the moon is full, it could be because the redsox won the World Series"" then showed me a book with different diets to ease symptoms, but did not refer me onto a nutritionist or pelvic floor physiotherapist. Last, he said ""you are going to have to learn to live with this painful condition for the rest of your life."" I am healthy now.",Male
"Terrible treatment from Dr Lafontaine on many levels. He only treats patients at Mt Auburn hospital on Fridays. That's it. After several weeks to get an appointment, I had a kidney stone that needed to be removed. 4 months later I had the surgery. The surgery didn't remove the stone and he didn't know that! He said to come back in 6 months to check. After 2 more infections caused by the stone I finally changed doctors and got immediate treatment. What a difference! Also his office was decrepit!",Male
"Dr. Lafontaine is a brilliant surgeon who cares deeply about his patients. He's great at explaining what's going on in your body &amp; he's got a dry sense of humor that I greatly enjoy. Most of all, I'd say he saved my life in his skillful operation on me to remove my bladder cancer. Highly recommend him.",Male
"Professional and reasonable, evaluates, and reevaluates current treatment plan.  This allows Dr LaGalle to implement ways to improve care and ultimately your health.  So not just more of the same, should there be something better.",Female
I have been with Dr. Lagalle for over a year and each time she was extremely understanding and explained it well. She has never rushed herself and has always been on time. She is an excellent provider whom I am recommending to my other family members.,Female
"I have been a patient of Dr. LaGalle's for a few years now and among this time the most common theme I have encountered has been the ""inability to reach her or her RN any time that I've called"". I leave messages to get back with me, whether it may be for a routine checkup or if I'm attempting to set up an appointment for a more serious matter, the result is the same.  This has been an ongoing theme, even prior to the Covid-19.",Female
She will help you find good solutions to problems by collaborating with patients. I highly recommend Dr LaGalle.,Female
Rude and condescending. Nurse is rude too.  Will find new GP as soon as possible. ,Female
"Dr. LaGalle is a Blessing to both my husband and I. I was having troble with my asthma and pain in my legs, Dr. LaGalle did all the right stuff. Thank You",Female
"Went to her after szilagye retired, talked down to myself and my family, was in hospital and fired her next day. No people skills, stay away!",Female
"I advise caution when considering Dr. LaGalle.  The minute she walked in the room I could tell something was wrong.  She immediately questioned all the medications I was taking, even vitamin D and niacin.  Her tone was hostile and condescending. She said she didn't know anything about one of the medications I was taking and FALSELY assumed I was HIV+.   I told her she was wrong and that I felt I was being discriminated against and asked to speak to a manager.   I advise avoiding her.",Female
This woman shouldn't be a doctor. They are supposed to help their patients not criticize them. Actual this doctor is one of the worst. My brother who is handicapped went to see her and she treated him like crap. The only time she touched him was only when she shook his hand. Then she told him to get out of her office. Terrible bed side manner. I give her a negative rating. You don't go around treating people like that. Get a different profession. ,Female
"Had to find a new Internist.  Chose Dr. LaGalle.  She was excellent on 1st visit.  Listened, engaged, thorough.",Female
"very clear with medical advice ,listens to all health issues and then some ,she has helped me on a personal level when i needed someone to talk to .treats you like your the only patient she will have the whole day!!

"My wife and I had twins back in April.  We've had four kids through Dr. Lagrand and his office.  Sarah was a huge help as well.  Dr. Lagrand and his staff are by far the best office in GR and I would say the whole state.  Maybe the country!  Our first two pregnancies were relatively normal.  Sarah delivered both kids and went very smoothly.  We absolutely love Sarah.  Our last pregnancy was a completely different story.  My wife had multiple issues throughout the whole pregnancy.  Every issue we had Dr. Lagrand, Sarah, and his staff were right there with us.  Talking to us at all hours of the night and seeing us on short notice.  My wife made it to 30 weeks and she had to be admitted to the hospital.  Both John and Sarah came to visit us multiple times.  As the husband, John would intentionally answer my many questions so I would understand.  My wife delivered via c section performed by Dr. Lagrand.  The procedure went seamlessly.  After the procedure, John and Sarah stopped by again t",Male
"I saw Dr LaGrand after many years of trying to get other providers to believe that I had a problem.  He was patient, kind and LISTENED!   I didn’t feel like I was crazy or had to defend why I was there.  He did a total hysterectomy for me and only 2 weeks out, I already feel better than I have in years!   He explained the healing process and why I need to follow his recommendations in a clear and down to earth manner - always making me comfortable.   Amazing doctor and so happy I found him.",Male
"Dr. LaGrand did a total laparoscopic hysterectomy on me April 28,2020.  At my preop he was very informative and drew pictures so I would understand exactly what would happen and on the day of my surgery he went over it again.  At my postop appointment today he again help me with what to expect in the coming weeks and cautioned me about over doing it at this point because I feel pretty good and drew me another picture(quite the artist).  I have been pleasantly surprised at how well this has gone and Dr. LaGrand made it so it wasn't as stressful- he has a wonderful bedside manner.  I have never had a big surgery like this and I can say I would definitely recommend Dr. LaGrand and Spectrum Butterworth.",Male
"Referred to Dr Lagrand by PCP because of prolapsed uterus. Did not know this surgery could be done laproscopically through belly button (only incision) and went home same day! Only on pain pills 3 days and surprised 5 at how amazing I felt. Dr Lagrand is highly  skilled and knowledgeable in this procedure. Not many surgeons can do it this way. At my pre/post visits, I felt like I was his only patient and his great sense of humor made me totally relaxed. He thoroughly explained everything and did the post op teaching himself. He clearly has a passion for what he does and puts the patient first. He even held my hand until I fell asleep in surgery.  I would highly recommend him to anyone because of the great experience I had!! Words to describe him: highly skilled, meticulous, thorough, efficient, and compassionate. I wish I would have had this surgery done sooner by Dr Lagrand!!",Male
"I was referred to Dr Lagrand by my Breast Health care physician for a possible tumor  on my uterus.  After total hysterectomy, at age 66, preformed by Dr Lagrand, he noticed that my vagina was extremely atrophied.  Yes, at age 44 I had gone through menopause.  I had pain during and after intercourse for over 20 years attributed to being post menopausal.  I have had the Mona Lisa procedure and it works!  I'm extremely happy that I had this treatment.  There is no more pain and my husband and I have a great sex life once again!!   Thank you Dr LaGrand",Male
"I was referred to dr LaGrand by my PCP due to large Fibromas in uterus. He was very nice to my husband and myself, explaining and making sure we understood everything. I had minimally invasive radical hysterectomy. Took my uterus out through small incision in belly button. It was about 4or 5 times the size of a normal uterus. Two weeks later I feel.very good. Still healing of course;). Loved the attention and dedication that Dr John LaGrand gave to my case. He is an amazing surgeon, and a very kind and dedicated healthcare provider. I highly recommend his services. Great professional and kind human being.",Male
Dr. LaGrand is amazing.  He answers all my questions and spends as much time as I need to be comfortable.,Male
"Excellent, Dr. LaGrand is compassionate and kind.  I had laser treatments that were painful but successful, and I was very satisfied with the procedure and care that I received.  ",Male
"I went through about 15 years of undiagnosed and untreated pain, and had multiple doctors (and OBGYNs) literally shrug at my symptoms. It was such a relief to see Dr. LaGrand.  He was the only one to validate my experience, and took the time to make sure I understood all of what could be going on. He was such a partner in making sure that I was comfortable with every step, up to and including a total hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy for endometriosis (turned out to be significant adenomyosis).  I'm now incredibly pain-free, and there are no marks on my belly - he only made an incision inside my belly button, and it looks so normal I can still wear bikinis! I did not know you could get an organ out of my abdomen with just one incision. Plus, bonus, after 2 kids and nearing 40, I can work out again without any bladder leakage.",Male
"Wonderful, caring Dr.  As a post menopausal  woman I had a few concerns with bleeding , hot flashes, itching and uncomfortable sex. Dr. LaGrand explained that as you age , body parts age also. Very easy to understand and also talked to my husband.  I had the Mona Lisa laser treatment done. What a difference in our sex life and itching went away. Yay. Took care of hot flashes with hormonal patch and IUD.  Yes, IUD at 72. Works.
Thanks Dr. Lagrand",Male
"Awesome physician!  He is a pioneer for single incision laparoscopic procedures.  He repaired my pelvic prolapse issues, and I experienced no complications whatsoever. He’s extremely knowledgeable and professional.  I highly recommend him!",Male
Dr. LaGrand is the most kind &amp; compassionate OB-GYN’s I have ever been to &amp; his skill is unmatched. I had a single incision laparoscopic hysterectomy &amp; bladder lift at age 36 due to uterine prolapse. He spent so much time with me and my husband answering all of our questions and held my hand as I went into surgery. His genuine care and concern for me as a patient for the last 10 years is why I highly recommend him. He is truly the best!,Male
"Dr. LaGrand is a kind, compassionate and highly trained specialist.  His time and care before, during and after surgery are what make him stand out from the rest.  Dr. LaGrand performed a minimally invasive complete Hysterectomy through the belly button with such care that I virtually have no scarring and had very little pain.  He explained the procedure in simple terms with some humor spread in.  I would recommend him to any one who is looking for a specialist while going though menopause.     ",Male
"Absolutely worst OB I’ve ever been to. Not only did Dr. LaGrand make me cry at my first apt, he belittled my midwife and tried to scare me that I was “going to end up with a child who would need care for the rest of their lives” I had a ultrasound a few weeks later, that I never got results for (it’s been a month now) AND they contacted my private midwife to tell HER they were dropping me as a patient, and to not plan on going to my apt/ultrasound the next day. I was told by John that even if I ",Male
"Dr. LaGrand is a wonderful doctor! He listens, he is so knowledgeable.  He did an amazing job, I healed so well and so fast!  I highly recommend him. Well worth a two-hour drive for me to go to his office.",Male
I had multiple surgeries with Dr. LaGrand and he was one of the best doctors I have had.  He had wonderful bedside manner and helped to put any of my fears at ease.  He also spent as much time as I needed at an appointment explaining things and understanding my thoughts and fears. He is the only doctor in the area I know of to do certain procedures mainly thru the belly button. His staff was wonderful to work with.,Male
"Dr. LaGrand is by far the best doctor I have been to. He loves what he does and it shows. His level of skill, care and teaching are unparalleled. He even throws in some humor to help me stay at ease. My hysterectomy went flawlessly, and I appreciate the education and care every step of the way. Dr. LaGrand came recommended to me and I will continue to recommend him to others. ",Male
"My purpose in writing this, is to let you know that Dr. John LaGrand is an excellent and experienced surgeon. Dr. LaGrand preformed my minimally invasive complete hysterectomy at the age of 65, due to prolapse. I was filled with apprehension about the procedure, until my consultation. He explained my situation and exactly what needed to be done. My surgery went well, with minimal pain. My regret, is that I waited so long. I wanted a better quality of life and Dr LaGrand gave me that- don’t wait!",Male
"Dr. LaGrand is THE BEST doctor I have ever worked with. He is very caring, compassionate, and helps you get to the root of the problem! He makes everything very clear and easy to understand, and is very thorough. He makes you feel very valued as a person, and not just like ""another patient"". He is very attentive to your needs and makes himself available should anything come up that needs immediate attention. I would HIGHLY recommend him!",Male
"Dr. LeGrand was excellent!  I had a total hysterectomy and bladder repair at age 44, something I was not expecting at this age.  He was down to earth, explained things well, and showed that he cared.  6 months prior to this surgery I had back surgery with blood clot complications.  I was very nervous about having another surgery, but Dr. LeGrand helped me feel comfortable and at peace.  I had no issues recovering and everything has gone smoothly.  I highly recommend him as a a surgeon!",Male
"I like Dr. Lahaie, she does listen to my concerns and seems to understand me.  I feel she is very compassionate.",Female
"She's a bit mild-mannered, but she listens to concerns and is careful not to over-medicate. Ex: I'm on a sleep medication, and mentioned I wanted to go up a dose because it wasn't as effective. We went up a dose. A few weeks later, I came back and said honestly that there wasn't much of a difference. She put me back on the 200mg because staying on the higher dose (which wasn't working) would put me at a slightly higher risk of side effects. (""It sounds like more potential for side effects with nothing in return."") I appreciate that she took me back down to the 200 mg, and instead offered two options for companion medications that might help instead. I appreciate that she's careful. I've never had a psychiatrist do that before. 

I've seen people say she doesn't have a personality, which I find to be untrue. We've talked about Star Trek, Disney movies, kids, and painting.",Female
Shes just kind of a zombie. She doesn’t really have a personality which prevents her from connecting with her patients. Doesnt care at all what the individual wants or needs. Just very textbook oriented. Just ignores you if you suggest something she doesn’t agree with.,Female
Dr Lahaie was very nice and I felt she understood what I was going through. She was patient and helped me understand what I was dealing with. I highly recommend. ,Female
"Dr. LaHaie seems to have a warm and caring heart for her patients. I didn't feel rushed and I was comfortable opening up to her. 
Overall Dr LaHaie recommended me for TMS for my depression and its kind of like having an MRI on my brain. I've completed 22 of my 36 treatments and I feel like myself again. I stopped with a couple of my medications and I feel like my old self again.
Thank you Dr. Lahaie, see you soon :)",Female
Great Doctor listen to me the entire time and then was able to give me a diagnosis and prescription that help me out. Felt like she knew me and understood everything about me. Office staff was cool.,Female
"I’ve had such a pleasant experience working with this doctor!  She is respectful, and listens carefully to my input before making a recommendation. She looks for out-of-the-box solutions instead of just pushing the same old drugs at me like every other doctor.  She is really focused on what works for me personally, and I’m grateful I found her. Also, everyone at Serenity is so helpful and caring. Making appointments is a breeze and I never wait more than 5 mins to see the doc. Great experience!",Female
"Dr. La Haie is great, especially now that she's moved to a new office in Gilbert. She was very kind and spent an hour with us at our first appointment. She was knowledgeable and helpful. I could tell she cared about getting the right diagnosis and treatment. She wasn't pushy about meds and recommended TMS for me. Hadn't heard of it before, but after learning about it, I am glad she told me about it.",Female
Calibrated. and worked out an amicable medication requiem Respect that she is a Doctor not aSocial worker. The so called Case managers are overworked and underpayed Take responsibility for your self ,Female
Dr lahaie is horrible i wont be going to her unless I absolutely have to ,Female
"This doctor and clinic may have moved to a new location, but their services have been reduced to verbally degrading clients. Asks if you know of anything that helps. Totally disregards any feedback you have about your treatment.  She says you just need more coping skills instead of addressing your medication.  Case managers will tell you one thing on the phone and when you get in the office they deny that they said that. Awful if you don't call in time. New location, services falling apart. ",Female
"I found her attitude to be condescending.  I felt like I was something she wanted to wipe off of her shoe.  She made assumptions based on little factual data and was a very poor listener.  She has also decided to interfere with my current relationship with another psychiatrist because she does not agree with my current care and wants to express her thoughts to him, after only meeting with me one time and I will never see her again. Beware of seeing this doctor if you truly need help.",Female
"Dana Jean LaHaie is a egotistical, unprofessional, unethical hack.  She looks down her nose at her patients.  She believes her diagnoses is always right and will not listen to anything you have to say.  She does not know anything about her patients personal lives.  She is totally unprepared for your appointment.  Because she works at a State Mental Health Clinic she thinks that everyone is there just to seek drugs.  She does not take into consideration that  every patient has different needs.

"I had a bad fall down a steep flight of stairs in my house. I became septic and was put on a ventilator and not expected to live. I made it and after 3 hard years of Physical Therapy I was walking again with a walker! I went on the roof to repair my ham radio antennas, I was swimming, doing maintenence around the house, driving dining out ect.I had gone as far as I could go and decided to ask LaMacchia for a consult. I walked IN with a walker and after surgery, as he was wheeling me to recovery, I suffered severe muscle spasms over my whole body which required large doses of Dilaudid. After I got home I continued to suffer terrible muscle spasms and sleep was impossible. After 2 years of this horrible convulsive muscle spasms I sought LaMacchias help. He asked me ""how long has this been going on""? I reminded him he saw for himself the first time it happened and that I never had any of the problems before he operated and he blew his steam!  I'm now confined to a wheelchair. Buyer Beware",Male
Terrible experience.  ZERO bedside manner.  He basically ignored me and grumbled swear words when his computer froze up.  Very agitated &amp; zero compassion or empathy.  I would not recommend him nor will I return.  Looking for a Dr. to be in my corner not to be annoyed that I exist.  Next.,Male

After I was waiting an hour in the room, he came in and started explaining my MRI using medical jargon that was absolutely no use to me. He was very condescending to any questions I asked and just very short with me.

His office is top-notch and everyone there makes you feel comfortable. He is the absolute best in my book and I highly recommend him to everyone.",Male
My family trusted this doctor for over 10 years. He treated an operated on multiple family members. We have totally lost faith and will no longer recommend him to anyone. He has abandoned his ability to feel compassion and overlooks treatment possibilities instead trusting the patients symptoms and taking precautions to seek the best possible treatment and outcome for the persons future. He has done harm by not verifying conditions and has never bothered to check on his patients since.,Male

So, at every step along the way I have been prepared and that gave me to confidence to keep going. I trusted him, and I would again.",Male
I met Dr. LaMacchia by accident. I was in a rear end car accident and was referred to him by my primary care doctor.

My son did not present on the outside as sick as he was on the inside. Dr. LaNoue ended up having to remove 60% of my son's bowels. Truly one of the most remarkable surgeons I have ever known. He saved my son's life when most thought he wouldn't survive. He is the best!,Male
"Dr. LaNoue was the surgeon on call when we discovered that our son, 13 years old, needed surgery for an appendicitis. As any parent would be, I was terrified at the thought of my child being operated on. After talking to my children's' pediatrician, who was happy to hear it would be Dr. LaNoue and meeting with him, I was much more comfortable. It is now 4 days later and all seems to be just as he said it would be. I'm very thankful for him taking such wonderful care of my sweet child.",Male
My son had umbilical hernia surgery and his bedside manner and personality really made me feel at ease.,Male
"I was new to this country, and my husband recommended her since she was his physician. She was not thorough with me, and prescribes things without doing an oral examination. After going to her a second time, and seeing her approach me in the same dismissive manner, I had to find another doctor. She did not explain, nor did she seem to care.",Female
Dr. LaPinska is a wonderful surgeon and person. She goes above and beyond in caring for you!!,Female
"Friendly, ""down-to-earth"", plain-spoken, professional - seems to care deeply about her patients!",Female
"Amazing Doctor to my daughter gave us the support no one else would she wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him, no one like him! ",Male
"Being very reluctant to undergo total hip replacement surgery because of my age and underlying conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, I was ultimately forced to make that decision because my hip collapsed .  My primary physician recommended Dr.LaReau and after further research,  I decided on Dr. LaReau. I could not be happier with my decision.  After only three weeks,  my incision was healing rapidly and I was walking unaided with almost no discomfort.  It has now been eight weeks and I feel great.  I would highly recommend Dr. LaReau to my family and friends.",Male
Dr. LaReau and the team at Hinsdale Orthopedics were fantastic. In two months after my hip replacement I was back on the tennis courts moving better than ever without any pain. The whole was smooth from pre surgery consultation to post operation follow ups. A truly top notch experience. ,Male
Dr. LaReau was great.. And his staff was the best...and Vicky.  I just love how she handle everything and I consider her the key to all things going right.. I was walking great within 2 weeks in 2019.  I need the other hip done now and maybe the lower back .  I hope they'll will be the ones to service me. Covid stop the next year service. Looking forward to my next experience with their staff.  Love you guys and recommend to everyone..,Male
"Dr. LaReau, Luke PA, Gretchen, Vicky is a great team!  I had hip replacement surgery in July 2020.  The team was very professional answered all my questions.  I had a very successful surgery.  I was referred to Dr. LaReau and will refer him to friends and relatives.",Male
"Dr. LaReau, Luke PA, Gretchen, Vicky-- what a great team!!  I had a total knee replacement May 2020.  From visit 1, they listened to all questions and took a conservative approach till I was ready for surgery.  Dr. LaReau &amp; Luke were always willing to discuss options and hear my concerns. Vicky is amazing to coordinate all appointments needed prior to surgery. Surgery went very well and walking that day &amp; went home!  Presently, my other knee is ok but would not hesitate to have Dr. LaReau perform the other total knee replacement when needed.  I would highly recommend Dr. LaReau as an orthopedic surgeon.",Male
"Dr. LaReau was extremely personable and interested in my well being.  He explained all my options regarding knee surgery and I did not feel pressured to do it, but because he was so confident I decided to do a full knee replacement with him.  He and his assistant Luke gave me great attention and answered all my questions.  His staff was wonderful and always called back immediately.  I was walking on my knee the same day.  His protocol to get his patients moving was exactly what I needed.  I would highly recommend Dr. LaReau to anyone!",Male
"I have both hips replaced by Dr La Reau a year apart with excellent outcomes. He is an excellent skilled surgeon. Takes time to explain things and I never felt rushed.
The pre and post op teaching he and his staff provided have me the confidence to achieve the success that I achieved.",Male
"I have to say Dr. LaReau is a life saver. My hip was really bone on bone. I had a total hip replacement. I could hardly walk. Dr. Lareau gave me my life back. Dr. Lareau is an exceptional surgeon. I will say if you need a hip replacement, this is the place to be. On a rating from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best, he's a 10+! Thank you so much.",Male
Dr. LaReau is amazing. I had a frontal hip replacement and was walking the same day. I was home the day after. I feel GREAT,Male
"Dr LaReau replaced one knee in June 2018 and the other in November 2018.  My long ""list"" of questions he patiently answered thoroughly.  Both procedures were performed at Good Sam and went so much better than I expected.  Pain level was so minimal I didn't take any pain meds after being released from the hospital. Would highly recommend anyone considering a knee replacement to schedule an appt with Dr. LaReau.",Male
"Dr. LaReau has replaced both of my hips. The first surgery was 3 years ago and the second late last year and I have just completed my annual checkup.  I left the hospital after each surgery the following day and walked out with a cane and minimal pain.  He is compassionate and extremely thorough and I am happy I choose him. As with all of my experiences with Hinsdale Orthopaedics',  everything went like clockwork start to finish.",Male
Extremely professional. Pre op and post op went exactly as planned. Excellent results with hip replacement. I recommend Dr LaReau and his team without reservation.,Male
"My hip collapsed in the socket while mowing the lawn in Aug./2017.
My GP Dr. Recommended Dr. Justin LaReau, so I called his office and was told the wait for an appt.
Was 5 wks.!
Since I could hardly walk, I saw another Dr., but kept the orig. appt. with Dr.LaReau which actually was my 2 nd opinion.
In the meantime , thru word of mouth, Dr LaReau's kept coming up-with rave reviews!!
Can't tell you enough, how glad I am to have kept the appt .
Dr.Lareau is the best you will find for hip surgery!",Male
"Like others who have written reviews, Dr. LeReau absolutely gave me my life back. Prior t having total hip replacement 4 months ago, I could barely walk and was in excruciating pain. Dr. LeReau confidently and with compassion assured me things would greatly improve after surgery. He was so right. His entire team, Sara, Tessa, Erin and Vicky were wonderful. Dr. LeReau personally called me back when I had some concerns. There are not enough rating stars to give to Dr. LeReau and his team!",Male
Dr LaReau performed my hip replacement 6 weeks ago.  I was in so much pain I walked with crutches for 3 weeks before my surgery.  I can't believe that in only 4 months I was walking almost a mile a day.   I am now up to a mile in the morning and a mile after dinner without any pain.  I can't thank Dr. LaReau enough for helping my life get back to normal.  I would highly recommend him to anyone contemplating hip replacement surgery.,Male
"Dr LaReau was willing to replace my right knee when other doctors were afraid to touch it because of a history of infection from a previous surgery by a different doctor. 
Dr LaRue impressed me with his respectful attitude, and understanding of the latest innovations in technique, materials, and infection prevention. 
Because of Dr LaReau's willingness to help me, I have regained a quality of life I didn't think possible!  I am very grateful!",Male
"Dr. LaReau has performed both of my hip replacements and he is amazing!!!  I thought it would be a painful and long recovery, but the opposite was true both surgeries.  I would recommend Dr. LaReau in a heart beat.",Male
"Dr LaReau, is easy-going always smiling and affable. When he's not smiling, its because he is listening intently or evaluating with the Eye and expectation of a perfectionist! 
 None of this really matters, considering that the Dr's, methods and results are that of a homerun hitter the likes of a Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Dimagio, or ""Mr. Cub ""Ernie Banks. 
That's all that really counts, isnt it complete perfection in the execution the  swing and the resultant grand slam homerun! My knees are proof",Male
My experience with Dr Lareau and his team at Hinsdale Orthopedics could not have been better.  My total knee replacement surgery was coordinated and organized by his highly competent and caring team.  From start to finish I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased at how well his team and the staff at Hinsdale Hospital worked together for my benefit and my positive health outcome.  I can unreservedly recommend Dr Lareau and his staff at Hinsdale Orthopedics.,Male
"I am so glad I found Dr LaReau to help remedy my arthritic hips. He performed total replacement of both hips. Everything went as promised. No surprises. Great results. His entire team and personal skills doing the Anterior approach to hip replacement really payed off. I had better mobility from the day of the operation. After 4 weeks am walking and performing normal chores that I would have never expected.  I felt that preparation, the procedure, could not have turned out better.",Male
Very personable and explains everything very clearly!,Male
"I am a patient of Dr Larock's and have been carefully monitoring a prostate problem. When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer Dr LaRock and I discussed my medical options. He took time as always (never feeling rushed) and I concluded the best remedy for me was to have my prostate removed. So, we set up a surgical date and I met his robotic surgical team. The surgery went like a textbook by his standards. I never experienced any harsh effects from having the surgery. Call Dr LaRock if needed. ",Male
Absolutely the best experience I've ever had.,Male
"I love dr LaRoque, I felt like she really listened and paid attention to my whole self, not just my injured ?? part! I really felt heard, never rushed and she felt easily accessible. My surgery was quick, painless and successful. I would recommend her to anyone!",Female
quick to dismiss.  ordered blood tests and they came back abnormal...  no phone call no follow up whatsoever.  ineffective as far as I can see.  ,Male
"Although I've only seen Dr Larose when I was a patient at Beverly hospital, he was extremely thorough with his exam and very  accurate in his diagnosis. He also has an excellent bedside manner explaining my condition and answering my questions and treatment options. I will look forward to seeing him for follow up treatment with him... ",Male

I was able to get in to see Dr. LaRose very quickly. From the receptionist on it was a very positive experience!  I felt like Dr. LaRose took all the time necessary and I didn’t feel rushed at all. I would highly recommend him!,Male

"Dr. Connor Larose was professional, informative, provided an honest opinion, thorough, and caring. I transferred to him after receiving a very poor consultation from one of his colleagues in the Redlands office.",Male
Dr. LaRose is a great doctor. Very knowledgeable. Repaired my sons acl and meniscus and my meniscus. Great overall experience,Male
Dr LaRose is an amazing doctor,Male
"Dr. Connor LaRose is like no other. He takes all the time that you need to understand clearly your condition and his feedback is always right on. He cares about his patients, and he strives to make sure you understand all of your options.",Male
Was able to get in quickly. Helpful and friendly staff. Dr. LaRose was very informative and took his time to explain everything.,Male
Did nt like the doc was rude  and n a hurry to c next person he didn't give me time to ask any questions,Male
"Went for a second opinion for my daughter, she had a second ACL year after a year. Dr. Was very informative, my daughter felt very comfortable in asking him questions. And he talked to us in a way we can understand. He will be doing my daughter’s ACL reconstruction.Thank you.",Male
"Dr. Larose is an awesome doctor!!  Very patient, he explains what the problems are in layman‘s terms, he makes sure that you understand what going on, he elicits feedback to make sure that you are involved in the process and the decision making. 
I would recommend him to my family and friends, I am that confident in him and his skills as a surgeon. 

The office staff are another issue. After getting off to a rocky start due to what I feel is a lackadaisical attitude amongst the staff, after addressing that issue things have been better.  And they seem to be continuing in that trend. 

Again the Doctor is a magnificent surgeon and a brilliant doctor but the staff need some fine-tuning.",Male
Dr LaRose is an excellent doctor he explains thoroughly what is the issue and gives you a thoughtful  treatment.  He treats well his patient with care and respect.,Male
"Dr. LaRose is friendly and knowledgeable, and I have the utmost confidence in him and his staff.",Male
Wonderful and very elobarote discussion,Male
"Arrogant, rude, lack of respect, superiority complex. Questions and/or concerns are not allowed! The most bazaar interaction I've ever had with a doctor. Definitely no professional.",Male
If you are an athlete do not go to this guy.  Get a 2nd or even 3rd opinion elsewhere.  He left me with a permanent injury from a surgery he performed on me NOT discussed prior to surgery.,Male
"Second visit today, 1 hour wait after arriving 10 minutes before appointment, receptionist is rude and obviously over her head, toilet is broken and it has no light. 
First visit doctor seemed annoyed to be bothered cutting my grandmas nails, said why she doesn't go to get a pedicure... her previous podiatrist PROHIBITED them saying it would make her problem worst. 
Going to do everything I can to get her another doctor. 
This place is terrible run don't walk to another office.",Male
"I think hes awesome I am so glad to have him as my doctor, I've been through three others that couldn't find any wrong and dr la rose did and fixed the problem without incident.  He's very thorough.  I always recommend him.",Male
First time visitors are no problem. It's all about making the money. If they don't feel they can make any off of you. You will be placed on hold when calling for return visits. Still having foot problems with no dr in sight.,Male
Dr LaRussa was our daughters Dr in the hospital and he was great! Very thorough and explained everything to us. The testing was extremely scary and emotional and he took the time to answer our many questions and made us feel like we were his only patient.,Male
"I began going to Dr. LaRusso about a year ago.  I have found Dr. LaRusso and her staff to be knowledgeable, caring, and thorough.  A few days ago Dr. LaRusso performed MOHS surgery on a cancerous spot on my head. Dr. LaRusso put me at ease in preparation for the surgery by thoroughly explaining the procedure before she began. Because of this, I was very confident during both the surgery and the post-operative procedures. Dr. LaRusso has wonderful bedside manners and I would highly recommend her office to anyone needling dermatology services.",Female
"I’m not referring her to any of my friends or family because she piseed me off, has no bedside manners and treated me like I didn’t understand anything she has said. I shared my concern that I was having pain in the area on my surgery and the spot was ozzing yellow.She went to how long it’s going to heal.  I said mame this pissed her of and told me not to call her mame. That was disrespectful. In America this is respect. I said again told her I understood the healing process my issue is the the yellow weeping and had pai. She began working on my area without gloves and or washing her hands. She told me she washed them in the hallway, but she also touched the door to come in my room. She then started repeating the same issues she wanted to. When I let her know I understood the healing process, she said I am not talking to you. That I can leave if I wanted, I told her she started this mess and I’m not going anywhere. 
I may be old but not stupid and I do need my concerns addressed.

"I am a patient of Sunwise Dermatology and all staff are wonderful from front desk staff to clinical staff and Dr. Larusso is wonderful.  I have taken 2 of my children there as well, one for acne and the other for a mole on his chin which was removed with such precision that there is no scar. I will continue to go to Sunwise for all our Dermatology needs.",Female
I had skin cancer by my eye and it was a fairly large piece. I had about 2 1/2 inches of stitches after the surgery. After the stitches were taken out you could hardly see that I even had surgery. The best thing about Dr. LaRusso is she treats you like a family member. She is genuinely concerned with your overall skin care. I do landscaping for a living and she is on me about not wearing enough sunscreen. I would not choose any doctor over her.,Female
"Very compassionate, took the time and listened to my concerns at my visit. She made me feel like family from the first visit and now I have my friends and family following up with her.  She completed my MOHs in January and my scar is almost invisable. Just an all around great Dermatologist and surgeon. Highly recommend ",Female
Dr Larusso is a very respectful and caring physician. She listens to what is going on and goes through every treatment and options that are available.

If anyone is looking for a caring Dermatology office &amp; a caring MOHS Surgeon, I would travel hours to come see you again, so thankful your so close",Female
"Wow, reading one of the previous reviews makes me wonder if we saw the same doctor!  Dr. LaRusso was so meticulous when it came to my surgery I felt like she was performing it on a relative.  She did everything she could to prevent scarring and was so nice and professional.  Pay no attention to the hate, it smells fishy.",Female
My son was seen by Dr. LaRusso recently in her new Middletown office. It was delightful to be greeted so personally and efficienciently by the front office staff. Only to get better with her direct medical team who took us back to gather the concerns I had for my 2 year old. Dr. LaRusso spent a good deal of time with us answering every crazy first time mommy questions I had about his delicate skin. This experience could not have gone better.,Female
"I visited this individual in June of 2015. I only just found this site, which is why my review is late. She is incredibly rude, condescending and absolutely unhelpful. I came to her because I have contact dermatitis (contact allergies) and after asking for help, she asked me why I was wasting her time. She kept telling me I was ""dark"" and that's all it was. She's just a terrible human being. She spent about 3 minutes with me, and then left. Don't waste your time or money going to this jerk.",Female
"Recently had the Moh's surgery.  Very satisfied with the care, concern, and quality of care.  As close to a Marcus Welby type experience as once can get in today's Medical arena.  It was wonderful to be treated like a person and not a factory experience.  Surgery scar looks great.  Dr. LaRusso takes time to consider the best outcome. Could not be happier with my experience.",Female
"I highly recommend Dr. Larusso to my friends and family.   She is very professional, warm,  and answers all my questions in detail.   She makes me feel like I am her most important patient. ",Female

"My visit was on time, (very important) was very thoughtful and well communicated between the doctor and patient.",Male
Great doc.....in and out in no time!  Loved his face mask!,Male

"Very thorough quick and painless
and I feel much better in just one day after my treatment. I highly recommend Dr. LaSalle",Male
"Absolutely  I would recommend Dr.LaSalle to my friends, family anyone.  It was actually a pleasure to do “business” with him.  Once you meet him, he always brings a smile with him and sometimes a joke or two.  But when it comes to talking surgery, he’s all about explaining what would be the best option for you, and let’s you make the final decision.  Then he opens up his computer and shows you in 3D color what will take place.  I’ve had 2 serious hand surgeries done by him, and I don’t regret either one.  The last one he just finished and just removed my cast.  He had to fuse my left wrist.  Just after 6 weeks you can barely see my scar.  He does great detailed work, and is a pleasure to visit with him each time I see him.  Have a Blessed Day Dr. LaSalle and thank you for going that extra mile with me each time by reexplaining something 2-3 times!!
A patient for a lifetime.......Debbie Feighner.",Male
Knows what he is doing.When he gave me the injection he says now you can say ouch instead if it’s gonna be a little pinch which no Cortizone shot hurts!!,Male

My recent visit with Dr. LaSalle was perfect as always. He is a wonderful surgeon with a kind and a little humorous personality.,Male
"Dr. LaSalle is an excellent doctor who cares about his patients.  He is quick and efficient at what he does and yet listens to one's concerns.  Recently he saw that I was experiencing pain on the way out from having been seen by another ONE doctor for a different problem, and worked me into his patient schedule to help me out that day.  He is skilled at giving hand injections from years of experience and has excellent technique to minimize pain.  Now that is excellence and compassion!  I so appreciate that!",Male
My experiences with Dr. LaSpina have been perfect in every way!,Male
"Went to him for second opinion, was thorough explained all option. Very nice man Short wait.",Male

"Dr. Laspina was extremely helpful, kind and thorough. He took a look at some of my medications and pinpointed a few possible reasons for the forming of the kidney stone from the meds I am on. He was also very patient with me and answered any questions I had in regard to my issue. Dr Laspina is an excellent , knowledgeable,  doc with a truly  compassionate  and caring manner. ",Male
"Made me feel comfortable in trusting him. Very thorough explanation of what was wrong with me, what the procedure entailed, what aftercare would be, as well as the long term prognosis. Also called me personally, once after my CAT scan to explain results and once the day after surgery to see how I was doing and to answer any questions. Cut my anxiety so much to know I was not 'just another procedure'. Easy to talk to. Very much recommended.",Male
"Excellent care. She was very nice, understanding, warm, thorough. She respected my personal life choices. She discussed the latest medical research and decision-making with me.",Female
"Dr. LaValley was in charge of my prenatal, and postnatal care as well as with my IUD. She is very sweet, caring and down to earth. She is very friendly and professional, and takes the time to listen to your concerns. Ive even recommended my mom to her. Great doctor!!",Female
I am so grateful I found Dr. LaValley. At my first visit she took the time to get to know me and my medical history better than any other doctor I have had.  She is so kind and compassionate and the communication is amazing.  She has called to check up on me or give me test results on her personal time.  All the staff that I have come in contact with are pleasant and helpful. It is so wonderful to have found a doctor that I completely trust.,Female

I hope I deliver the baby when she is on call, and I recommend her wholeheartedly!",Female

"I was seen by Dr. L at CFRH  for serious trauma related injuries, he and his team basically saved my life, he was very empathetic and compassionate, explained what he could for me to understand, I'm in construction, and sewed me up and had the best specialist see me for my broken bones. He really cared about what happened to me. ",Male
Would recommend Dr. LaVie. Very professional and has really helped me!,Female
"I have seen Dr. Lavie two times. Both times, I left her office in tears. I had nasal surgery 18 months ago and was infected.  I have pseudomoneas at the surgety site and it has spread. The symptoms have remained the same (red and swollen nostril, with green mucous that smells really bad!). The bones in my nose hurt. I have a red swollen cheek. I have tried many antibiotics and it goes away for a week and then returns. It has spread to the other nostril, and my middle ear on that side hurts. When I decided to see Dr. Lavie she did not offer to examine me, do another culture, or go over treatment options. She kept saying that she was a doctor and that I was not going to tell her what to do. Both times she said to go home and take nothing. I told her that the first time I saw her and did that my lymph nodes in my neck swelled up like golf balls. She was unphased.  The ENT nurses did a lot of work to send faxes, and I spent months waiting for an appointment. I have to start all again!",Female
"I have had pseudonomeas in my nose since surgery 18 months ago. I have seen her twice and both times she fussed at me for taking antibiotics. However, she did not offer another plan to treat it. She said to go home and take nothing. Pseudonomeas can spread and lead to death. She does not care! She would not even look in my nose with a light or order a culture. The symptoms are severe, but she did not believe me. ENT nurses spent a lot of time sending faxes that she requested. I waited months to get an appointment, but she did not help me and I felt worse after seeing her.",Female
BEST! DR! EVER!,Female
"He is an amazing doctor who is truly Worth calling and trusting as a doctor. He has great bedside manner even if he has pulled a double shift (like in my case). Is kind, treats and listens to you carefully. Hoag is veryyyyy lucky to have him.",Male
"This man who claims to be a doctor saw me in ER from distance and didnt even come close. He said you must have anxiety problem and if you dont accept being medicated, I cant approve treating you. I had no anxiety but a heart issue! Larer I found out he was gossiping about me. Why anxiety medication? I guess he has low self esteem and medicating patients with anxiety drugs is his way of dominating patienrs. He deserves no license to practice and no job. ",Male
Dr. Laakaniemi is one of the best emergency room doctors I have dealt with. He was knowledgeable and new exactly what I was dealing with. He was quick to see me yet took his time listening to my concerns. He put me at ease and made me feel comfortable ,Male
"I saw Dr. Laakso for help with a bout of severe anxiety- She gave me samples of Vraylar, a brand new drug to treat bipolar disorder, which made my anxiety much worse. I am NOT BIPOLAR-  When I failed to improve, she became angry and told me that no other psychiatrist would have agreed to accept me as a patient, as I was ""so off."" I never went back, and would warn anyone else to avoid her- She is out of her mind and a danger to patients-",Female

"When I came to her 9 years ago my medication dosage was too high. I was concerned that my health was deteriorating but, she told me that under no uncertain terms was that the case.  I needed less medication and to make some lifestyle modifications.  At her urging, I starting going to bed early and rising early.  I exercised outside in the sunlight all year and gave up alcohol.  I credit much of my happiness to her encouragement.  She has always made it very clear to me that I am very capable.",Female
A monster with a license!!,Female
"I spent years searching for help for my son. Dr. Laakso diagnosed him properly after seeing 3 doctors who didn't. She not only saved his life, but my husband and mine as well.
Today, years later, she continues to treat him and I have my son back from the brink.",Female
"Dr. Laali was amazing!  He was very kind, patient and thorough.  He took his time to explain things and did not rush.  I am so thankful for Dr. Laali!",Male
"Dr Laaly may have a wealth of knowledge, but he severely lacks bed side manner. My husband was brought to the ER and was on an oxygen machine. When the ER doctor decided he would be admitted, Dr Laaly entered to take over(apparently) He was immediately abrasive, kurt, rude and even raised his voice to my husband. He barked at my husband as if my husband were his employee. Dr went into the hall where I saw the ER Dr say something to him. He then returned and began apologizing, but it was too late",Male
"I met Dr. Laartz while  I was in the hospital very ill !! He was so kind, very empathetic &amp; So professional! ",Male
"Quick to diagnose. If it werent for his quick judgement, my infection could have spread even more. 6 weeks after my pic line was put in, I was all well. Thank you Dr. laartz.",Male
She's very thorough and understandingredients. I trust her immensely. ,Female
"Dr. Adofo was patient with my Mother-in-law who is 86.  She took the time to explain her condition and made Mom feel comfortable.  By the time we left her office, Mom was laughing and smiling.  Dr. Adofo is a consummate professional and I am very grateful for her.",Female
This Dr. gave me a joke of an exam.  I was diagnosed with kidney stones and I was in extreme pain. I had to call multiple times because no body answered the office phone even during office hours.  After 42 years in practice I think it's time to retire.,Male
"Wonder full Dr he was my anesthesiology 
For surgery",Male
"From what I could tell, “comprehensive” is about keeping a lucrative drill mill running. That place doesn’t care about people: Guang Yang surreptitiously cut medicine for no cogent reason I was on for over five years. When I alerted management and Lababidi to the problem, they could care less, and refused to get back with me. In other words people, this place will let you twist in the wind, no matter what the hardship, but will schedule (as for me) dangerous non-fda approved epidurals are every visit.",Male
The place this guy works at is a drill mill that is known to arbitrarily cut off people’s medicine for years. A completely disgusting experience from my own experiences which I wouldn’t wish on anyone. Way way way better and much more compassionate alternatives than “Comprehesive”,Male
"I've been a patient of Dr. Lababidi's for more than ten years now.  My left foot was nearly torn off in a vehicle accident (I was a passenger) more than forty years ago.  After a series of surgical procedures did not improve my left foot's function, I sought help to relieve the pain I live with every day.  Thanks to Dr. Lababidi and his staff at Comprehensive Pain Management, I'm still able to work full-time, play music in bands on weekends and live a (mostly) normal life.  I have advice for chronic pain sufferers who think any medical practitioner can take all of the pain away, I have news for them....they'll never completely get rid of the pain.  Go in with reasonable expectations and you'll be pleased with Dr. Lababidi's approach, which is different for each patient.",Male
"Dr Lababidi is an excellent physician. I have been treated by him for a few years now for a complex problem, and he has taken the time to get to know me as a person and to go the extra mile to investigate my disease and to find the best treatment options. He is always kind, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. I would not go anywhere else for pain management. ",Male
Dr. Lababidi has taken care of me and tried to ease my pain and find answers for that pain for almost 2 years. His bedside manner and willingness to listen has made me raise my expectations for a pain doctor!,Male
"First let me say I am not a patient who was uncomplient. I did everything I was told. this not out of anger. Frankly it's out of a broken heart and disbelief. I had a excellent Dr at Akron general. I was too be moving out of state but that feel through. Set up to talk to Tony.
2 hrs before Tony cancelled it. He wouldn't even let me come to even talk to him. He was my friend, I trusted him yet he betrayed me.
No matter how u justified it Tony
You were wrong, shame on you.
Make this right Tony.",Male
"Dr Lababidi seems to know what he is talking about, but he is stretched too thin between too many offices (I think he has five). It is VERY difficult to make an appointment with him because he is so busy. ",Male
Worst ever!!!!,Male

"I’ve had extreme difficulty getting my high blood pressure medication refilled due to lack of communication, I’ve requested call backs with no response, and had the staff be rude and condescending with me over the phone.  If my medication(s) help the longevity of my life, yet Dr Lababidi &amp; his staff are the reason I’m not getting them refilled, that would also mean my death would be on their hands!",Male
"Gilbert Cardiology is well organized place in terms of staff, scheduling, and billing.  Dr Lababidi is professional and skillful.  He performs all required tests to identify potential or serious heart issues.",Male
New patient recommended to me from my brother who had a great experience with him.,Male
"Excellent doctor, explains heart issues perfectly listens to questions and pays attention to details",Male
"If you value your health, avoid these guys like the plague. They can't even give you a proper blood pressure reading. If you don't have a heart problem when you get there, you will when you leave. The staff is awful. After a two year experience, I will assume these reviews were written by the staff.",Male
"I am a Fountain Hills patient and have always had a great experience . Feel comfortable with Dr. Lababidi and confident that I have gotten personal attention and great care. A shout out to Sharolyn who always makes me feel at ease as well as making me feel that she cares. Also to Rick, always a smile on his face and answer questions. A great team. ",Male

Before the EMTs arrived, my heart had already been in ventricular fibrillation and I knew I was dying.  I was brought directly into the cath lab and Drs. Lababidi and Dib saved my life. Two arteries were blocked (one 100% and one 90% ultimately 5 stents were placed. They resuscitated me five times. Today my quality of life is very active.",Male
"My experience was not a positive one with Dr.Lababidi, Gilbert Cardiology.  
1. The doctor I was seeing left the practice without warning or notice.  
2.  I was notified my insurance was no longer taken by the practice 2 days before my appointment to schedule replacing my ICD.  Please understand I had been seeing the doctor frequently for years, sometimes monthly,  
3.  They sent me to collections over a $105 discrepany.  The doctor that skipped out of the practice told me zero due for procedure",Male
"office is excellent, every one here, he is superb at keeping track of your health, thorough, takes you off medicine if not needed. ",Male

Couldn't be a better physician in the world like Dr. Lababidi,Male
"My daughter was diagnosed with SVT and MR. Lababidi, told her that she was faking it. We took my daughter to a KC hospital and they found that she did in fact have SVT and fixed her problem with radio frequency ablation. Labibidi should not be practicing medicine on children, since he seems to have a problem misdiagnosing them. My daughter is now 21 and hasn't had a problem with her heart since we went to Children's Mercy.",Male

Such a very nice Dr. Listens and is very patient and understanding. Been seeing him for 2 years due to car accident and couldn't ask for a nicer Dr,Male
"Dr. David Labadie has truly earned a five star rating from me.  Based on being an active athlete, Dr. Labadie has been very successful in addressing miniscus tears in both knees.

Two months ago, a full left knee replacement was done; bone on bone pain kept me from walking more than a few blocks.  The surgery now allows me to be walking 5+ miles each day.

My primary care doctor had indicated that his experience with Dr. Labadie's patients has been consistently very positive.

Critical (very positive) comments about the full knee replacement surgery : 1) the incision is healing very well and length of the incision is minimal, 2) the knee is feeling solid and the swelling is very minimal at this time, 3) no complications, 4)  I've alway felt like Dr. Labadie was responsive to my inquiries, 5) with physical therapy sessions and daily therapy exercises, this surgery experience is now beyond my expectations.

Dr. Labaddie and his staff are very skilled in providing knee surgery.",Male
"This  Surgeon should not even be allowed to help patience.  My husband went in for a meniscus clean up which also included cutting some of it off. ""Dr."" Labadie sent him back to work a couple of months later even though my husband said that he didn't feel right back to work with no restrictions.  Sure enough he fell and actually retour his meniscus again. Labadie was not willing to do another MRI to find out and even had the arrogant remark I did a good job go back to work. We saw a different Dr",Male

Went to him for second opinion after mastoidectomy surgery done by another Nashville doctor. Of course he wasn’t going to say anything about how surgery was done!!! He may be alright for pediatrics but I don’t recommend for adults who have chronic life long ear problems!!! He did Nothing to help me!!,Male
Dr. E. Labadie is awesome and his nurse is aswell. They make me feel extremely comfortable. I've been to several obgyn before I found Dr. Ladabie.

"I would not recommend this ""Doctor"" to anyone. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and finally went to see him to get on new meds after years without any and he threw his hands in the air and said there is nothing he can do for me and told me to get out because he had other patients waiting. Screw this guy. Extremely rude and indifferent towards my conditions. Waited 2 months to get in to see him and this is what happened. Find someone else if you can. I do not recommend him.",Male
"Doctor Alice Ma is AMAZING!!!
She worked tirelessly to find out the rare genetic blood disease of my husband!!! She stays in contact with her patients, makes them feel like they are her only patient!!!

"Dr. MA is a friendly, approachable, dedicated and compassionate health professional. Even with his busy hectic clinic time he finds time to explain and interact with you without pressure. He returns your call when you needed to talk to him. It is not only his medical know how that makes him a good one, but the warm and respectful interaction with his patient is what matters the most. Dr. Leena Jaitley has a warm respectful interaction too.",Male
"So I went to her about 15 years ago....specifically filled out HIPAA form stating DO NOT SHARE/NO AUTHORIZED PERSON.  Pretty clear, right?  Then discovered she shared the results with my family member while I was still under, in recovery.  NOT COOL.  When I spoke with her about it in follow-up, she dismissed me.",Female
"I met with Doctor Ma earlier today and was very pleased with our interaction.  She was very thorough in listening to my symptoms, and spent an extended period of time going through a treatment plan.  I found her to be very personable, and with a ""straight to the point"" approach to evaluating a diagnosis.",Female
"She is by far the worse physician anyone can have!!!
I have had a colonoscopy with her three weeks ago. After two days, I was in the Emergency Room, with kidney stone. During a Ct Scan, the doctors foud out that I have a cyst on my liver and other complications. I brought out to her attention and she didn't even want to know about it!!
She just told me to follw up with a family doctor!! She is my gastroenterologist, for God sake!!

"Dr. Ma has been my gastroenterologist since 2008. She is professional, knowledgable and the best at what she does. Because of my family history, I've had to have regular colonoscopies - all performed by Dr. Ma.

I have never had a bad experience there and would highly recommend her to anyone for excellent care.",Female
"Unprofessional, not nice, money hungry doctor. Scheduled me for a procedure without explaining plan and that it would cost me. Procedure was scheduled in December and due to me changed insurance companies, it filed it as if I didn't have insurance at all. Now I have a collection agency calling me requesting a mortgage rate payment for a procedure that took her less than 10 mins - greedy. Would never go there again or refer anyone to go to her. Disgusting!",Female
"This guy is horrible. Recommended surgery instead of chemo and immunotherapy, which he should have seen from the PET scans that the tumor was too big to excise. A different oncologist, based on seeing the PET scans, said that he would never recommend surgery. Avoid Dr. Austin Ma at all costs!!",Male
"I went to my family doctor, and my tests show an enlarged spleen and he suspects I may have leukemia.  I got the approval from my IPA to see Dr. Ma  and called the office.  The person I spoke to told me he couldn't schedule my appointment because my doctor hadn't sent my medical records.  I asked him to request them, and he told me to do it myself and hung up.  I did.  No call back.  Today, I called and a person came on the line and was SO RUDE to me, and hung up on me.  Horrible office staff!",Male
"When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was not comfortable with my surgeon.  I decided to get two other opinions in the two other biggest health systems in San Diego.  By far, Dr. Ma, at Scripps, and her staff were the best.  Dr. Ma took more time with me then the other two surgeons.  She is kind, compassionate, listens to your concerns and answers all questions thoroughly.  I felt I was in the best hands!!!!  I had surgery and now, cancer-free!!!!  ",Female
"Reception and Doctor - The worst.

She safe my  life  using a cutting edge procedure to  apriach every patient care.",Female
Dr.  Ma is a wishy-washy doctor who is more concerned about her cronies in the medical field than about her patients. Her credentials and experience are not obvious. She does the filling for other senior doctors who dictate verbatim what she has to say and do.,Female
"Incredible, competent, and compassionate surgeon.

This is not a good doctor. Don't trust her please. So you won't be traumatized like I did.,Female
Wasted over an hour waiting for first appointment only to be rescheduled. Office needs better planning. ,Female
"She listens, is compassionate, explains clearly, helpful.",Female
There is usually an one hour waiting time from my appointment.  Usually he has one other patient or none in the waiting area but does not lessen my wait time.  He just reviews my old reports and tell me that I am okay.  He always forget to tell me everything and calls me back if I am still there or on the phone if I left.  His staff is kind of kooky too.  ,Male
"I was worried about having shoulder surgery because of the pain involved. Dr. Ma and the entire staff are absolutely amazing and I could not be happier. I'm so impressed with how professional everyone is and how everything gets done in a timely manner. I never felt rushed and every question was answered before I even asked it.

"Dr. and his staff courteous, friendly, listens to your concerns, appointments have been always on time. Have had very little pain and discomfort 3 weeks post surgery.

He was very thorough in evaluating my problem, getting a series of x-rays and a complete history. His focus was on me and my health; that was super reassuring. After surgery, before I went home, he stopped in to see how I was doing and gave me helpful instructions on how to handle my rehab. Very generous with his time!

"The 5-star reviews here are probably not for the same surgeon we encountered 10 years ago in the UCSF Orthopedics department. Out of many surgeons in this department that we (myself &amp; others) have had contact with, this Dr is the least-skilled, in several respects. Luckily, I've been able to refer patients who needed important procedures, to other surgeons in the SF Bay area, who are in a different league from Dr Ma, to put it mildly.",Male
"Dr. Ma was extremely well-read, thorough, and compassionate in handling my case. I would recommend him to anyone.",Male

"Dr. Mah: Unfortunate example of clinician with no communication skills. Abrupt, disinterested,  more interested in what he had to say, preoccupied, and exactly what you don't need or want in a physician, particularly someone advising you about a condition that can lead to loss of sight. I should have read NW Retina's  reviews prior to my appt.",Male
Dr Ma is extremely good at explaining everything.  He is the key factor to my granddaughter not losing her eyesight due to a rare disease she has.  Dr Ma is awesome.,Male

She was very helpful every step of the way and I always felt like she was in my corner. Personable, easy to talk to, and empathetic. 

Post-surgery, Dr. Ma has been attentive, answered all of my questions promptly, and given me a brand new life. I live a life without chronic pain--I sleep better, can run without extreme pain/discomfort, and feel like this was how I was truly meant to look.",Female
"Dr. Ma is amazing! My daughter and I both went to see her about a breast reduction and she changed our lives. My daughter is in high school and has struggled with very large breasts while trying to play soccer and fit in with all the other girls. We worked with Julie in Dr. Ma's office and she helped us get my daughter's procedure approved. This procedure was life changing for her. She can work out without feeling selfconscience, her back and neck no longer hurt and she can wear clothes that actually fit her body. 
After my daughter had the procedure she encouraged me to see Dr. Ma as well. I did and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. My back feels great and my whole body feels lighter and more mobile. My only regret was that I didn't do it years earlier.  It will change your life!",Female
I had a breast reduction surgery in July performed by Dr. Ma. I could not be happier with the results! She did an absolutely beautiful job! I look and feel amazing. There wasn’t a single hiccup in my recovery and she was there every step of the way! Dr. Ma explained everything to me and gave me a very realistic idea of what to expect. She is an extremely caring surgeon and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to have this type of surgery.,Female
"Dr. Ma did my breast  reduction in May 2019. Before I went to see Dr. Ma I was having breathing problems and I thought I was having heart problems as well. I went to my primary Dr. and he sent me to Dr. Ma. I was also on three different meds for my breathing.  I am now off all three meds and only have a rescue inhaler if needed. My back pain is gone my sciatic nerve pain is all but gone and my shoulders don't ache anymore, and best of all I can breath again. Not to mention I haven't been able to sleep on my back in years and now I can. Please stop thinking about a reduction and get it done, It has been a life saver for me. Thank you Dr. Ma.",Female
"Dr. Ma combines being an amazing surgeon with compassion and true caring for her patients.

I went to Dr. Mar, discussed the issues, had the surgery and my only regret is not having done it sooner.  Highly recommended",Female
"Dr Ma did a great job on my breast reduction. The results were great. They are just the right size.  She spent a lot of time with me to prep for the surgery and her staff helped with the insurance justification.  Although the surgery is more major than I thought it would be, I had a good recovery with no complications.",Female
"I met with Dr.Ma today and I am completely amazed on how she has all ""good"" reviews. I cannot say the same thing, I regret having gone to the appt, she kept interrupting me and would not once give me a chance to finish my sentence. Dr.Ma didn't care one bit to hear on how I got my burn scar, she kept rolling her eyes every time I spoke, she was rude and in such a hurry. Dr. Ma, you don't deserve a nickel out of my pocket.",Female
"The BEST surgeon. Candid and yet professional. Very knowledgeable,  Communicates clearly.  Breast reduction done with great care and detail.  Reduced 7 sizes and beautiful.

Almost 4 months ago Dr. Ma performed a breast reduction surgery on me.  I feel like a new person. The pressure relief on my neck and shoulders was immediate and amazing.  I can work out without pain.  I can jump &amp; jog which I haven't been able to do for years without pain. Dr Ma did a beautiful job according to my husband and I highly agree!  Dr. Ma's team at the hospital were amazing as well as Kathy in her office.  I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Ma she was wonderful.,Female
"My Internist highly recommended Dr Ma after I was advised to have back flap surgery by another PS due to the fact that one of my breasts had been previously radiated. Dr Ma did my reconstruction after a double mastectomy without the added surgery and my experience with her was nothing less than wonderful. She walked me through every step of the way and her personal care and attention makes all the difference. I am so glad I chose Dr. Ma!

I have to tell you I look amazing now I can hold my head up high and put behind the last two years.  I highly recommend Dr. Ma if you are needing reconstruction from a mastectomy.  I only wish I would have found her sooner.,Female
"I saw Dr. Ma on a recommendation from my primary care physician about two years ago. I was 64 then and my drooping eyelids were interfering with my vision. I had a consult with her and found he arrogant, and condescending. When I told her I was a smoker she responded that I would have to stop for at least 8 weeks before she would perform surgery on me and that she was strongly against smoking. Her attitude was horrible. Then her receptionist kept calling and pestering me to make an appointment.",Female
"In 2015 I found out I was BRAC2 positive. I was given several options one of which was to undergo a bi-lateral mastectomy with breast reconstruction.  My mastectomy surgeon recommended seeing Dr. Ma, which was the best decision I could have ever made. My results are amazing. Dr. Ma was able to save my nipples and my breast look just like they did before, just perkier :).There are no words to describe my gratitude. Thank you for saving my life.",Female
Dr Ma was thorough and clear in her explanation of the procedure.  Environment was warm and inviting.,Female
"Dr. Ma brings fantastic skills to her practice. I've worked with her twice in the past ten years, and plan to return again.  I'm confident with her approach. She cares about her patients. Imho, her female perspective is important. She understands how to help women feel better - not overdone. If you're considering some work, go see Dr. Ma for a consultation. I think you'll agree.",Female
"Horrible stay away!!! Breast implants are way too low and small, they look like droopy tennis balls, and Dr Ma would not discuss a revision....she was arrogant and mean. So disappointed!!!",Female
"I am 62 year old female that had saline implant surgery 20 years ago. The implants had hardened and were causing discomfort. Dr Ma listened carefully and suggested removal or
putting in smaller saline or the new and improved silicone implants.  Opted for the silicone.
The surgical center was superior and Dr Ma was so encouraging and professional.Smaller,
softer and the down time was minimal. I highly recommend Dr Ma.",Female

"Dr. Ma was very friendly, courteous and most important, he listened.  I found Dr. Ma to be informative, but not overbearing with instruction. 
He made an adjustment to my prescription, actually decreasing the strength of one lens which, to my happy surprise, has made a difference in the positive side, with many vision.
I would lightly recommend Dr. Ma as a provider.",Male
"Dr. Ma was the attending doc when my dad was a patient at Chester Cty. Over the past month, I have encountered tens of medical professionals within the Penn system. Dr. Ma was the first who really impressed me. His skill and knowledge of possible causes of my dad's illness reassured us of his capability, but his kindness and the time he took is what makes him a standout.  He took his time with us and coordinated care with other docs to ensure dad's recovery. ",Male
I have COVID 19 and called him. It has been three days and several phone call but no doctor or nurse call back. The worst doctors and office I have ever encountered.,Male
"If this is the same Dr. Ma that is at Virginia Hospital Center with Virginia Physicians in McLean, he is excellent! I am extremely picky with doctors. He takes his time with me, always explains what is happening, and clearly has a lot of knowledge. I highly recommend him! I have tried a few doctors in the DMV area and not found one as thorough, knowledgable, accurate, and caring as Dr. Ma. Thank you Dr. Ma!!",Male
"Not a trauma aware doctor. Good luck if you’re going through any major life issues. Office manager calls complaining that I called the receptionist a name to the nurse (mind you, not the actual receptionist). I had been raped and gone through a forensic exam at WHC three weeks earlier. Unrelated, I’m dealing with a concussion hat is further screwing he up. But they choose to call and bother me with that nonsense while I’m trying to keep it together. Avoid this doctor. Avoid this practice.",Male
"Dr Ma is by far the best doctor I have ever had. I have recently moved to Tennessee, and have not been able to find a doctor that even come close to the level of care that Dr Ma provided me and my son. ",Male
1988 I had a back surgery  fusion lumbar 4 and 5 since then I have not had a single problem since then and it’s now May 2019. My back has been trouble free all this time. I highly recommend Dr. Ma if surgery is needed. He explains everything thoroughly and the options.  Thank you Dr. Ma for giving me my quality life all these years.  L. Lee,Male
Impersonal and short with patients. Lack of explanation and vague after care instructions. Gave me a note to return to work before I was stable or saw a specialist.,Male
"I strongly recommend Dr. Ha.  My wife, who has chronic heart disease, suddenly couldn't breathe and started to go unconscious at our home.  I called 911 and Oside EMT's/Fire quickly came to our house and transported my wife to Tri-City Hospital ER.

My wife had gone into congestive heart failure and was dying.  We made it to the ER like 7:03am and Dr. Ma and his Team fought hard for quite some time to save my wife's life.  I was there in the ER room as he saved her.  He's THE BEST!  BK Baker",Male
do not recommend ,Male
Schedulling an appt is easy but when you are at the clinic the waiting period is about 2 hours. Setting an appt is useless. You have 1pm appt but the dr. Will attend you at 3pm. He talks a lot and explain everything but sometimes it is not necessary anymore coz he talks a lot and he will prescribed a medicine that is not your chief complaint. It is a wrong diagnosis. Make it sure to double check every medicine he will prescribed it may harm you more.,Male
"Dr. Ma has been a blessing to me.  After a bilateral mastectomy and radiation, my first breast reconstruction (done by another plastic surgeon) was not successful.  Dr Ma performed a latissimus flap and the results were amazing.  Dr Ma took the time I needed to understand the procedure so that I went into the surgery with confidence.  Her associate, Dr. Metcalfe, was excellent as well.  Lindsey was supportive and extremely helpful and the entire staff was warm and welcoming. Dr Ma was truly an answer to many prayers.",Female
I visited Dr. Ma after being diagnosed with DCIS and needing a double mastectomy.  She is simply amazing.  She is a breast cancer survivor herself and really understands this process and what you are going through when you are diagnosed and need reconstruction.  It can be demoralizing but Dr. Ma and her amazing staff really care and put you at ease both pre and post op.  I recommend her for any plastic surgery needs. ,Female
"I met with Dr. Ma to discuss a cosmetic procedure and she took her time &amp; explained the whole process thoroughly so I decided to proceed with the procedure. She was very comforting through the whole process. Her office staff is very friendly, welcoming &amp; professional. If you want a warm, smart, caring doctor then I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Ma!",Female
The authentic compassion and care Was definitely missing from this practitioner. I watched my nipple turn into a  Wrinkled razon With a chest expander and for almost 5 years  because It was ignored every time I requested that they inflate it or adjust it I was ignored. Now that nipple is contracted and malformed. This shrinkage and contraction could've and should've been prevented with proper care of the chest expander.,Female
"Dr. Ma performed breast reconstruction surgery for me.  Scar is fine; but, there are many things about the surgery that I am not happy about.  The implant hangs low and way under my armpit, there are ripples in the cleavage area; and now I have developed so much scar tissue around the implant that I am in constant pain!  Dr. Ma gets easily offended if you ask questions about her work.  I was so nice, but she got curt with me and even pinched me roughly during examination because she was offended",Female
"I have recommend Dr. Ma to absolutely everyone who may have a need for any type of cosmetic or reconstructive surgery. There is no one better!

She is an excellent physician and a wonderful person that cares deeply about her patients and works very hard every single day. ,Female
"From my first appointment to the follow ups after the DIEP procedure, I have never felt such  compassion in my 2 years of dealing with several breast cancer issues. I was lifted out of a very dark time in my life due to Lindsey, PA and Dr Ma's expertise in putting me back together. The level of care and the results of my surgery exceeded all of my expectations. The entire staff within Dr Ma's office were beyond professional and exhibit the same genuine care and comfort as Dr Ma.",Female
LAWYER UP! Dr. Ma did an adominalplasticy (tummy-tuck) originally 11/2015 and she had to redo twice over the next 6 months.Not only did she cost me a year of my life but my job of 13 years.She is not qualified to do this procedure.Her reputation at Piedmont is that she leaves the OR to have lunch or talk on the phone.She will not answer your questions. I have to have YET another surgery by another dr to fix my mangeled stomach. Negligent horrible human.I took witnesses to every appt. HORRIBLE.,Female
"Dr ma performed a reconstructive surgery on me which turned out bad, now I am having to see another PS to straighten out the problems.  I don't trust her anymore to do them.  Her staff was nice and helpful. ",Female
"My experience was horrible.  My breast do not look like any of the pictures.  I had a mastectomy on my left side and it doesn't even look like a breast after reconstructive surgery.   It has alot of tucks, no shape, (goes under my arm), the scar looks like she used butcher knife.  Looks like a wad of Play doh.  
She wouldn't let me know what was going on or her plan even after asking her.   I would have an appt. with her but not see her.  She was curt and unfriendly.  Her staff was better.",Female
Dr. Ma did my reconstruction after a masectomy and did a wonderful job. Everyone in the office is so kind and suppprtive.,Female

"As a discerning patient, my search for a plastic surgeon had a number of very specific qualifications.
I wanted a board certified plastic surgeon whose education, reputation, professionalism and trust were beyond reproach. In Dr. Ma I found all that and more.
Thank you Dr. Ma.",Female
"She is the best!! She's very positive and honest.  She helped me gain faith when I was ready to endure my eternal resting place.  She gave me hope.  Without her, I may have not moved forward with my life.  She is concerning and caring.  She listens and put herself in your shoes.  For she has been.  I truly thank her for all she has done for the last 3 years.",Female
DR MA did not listen to me when I said my implant was painful. She told me to take pain killers for  the rest of my life. I went to another doctor who removed my implant and said I had scar tissue that needed to be removed. My new implant is much better than the one Dr Ma did.,Female
"I could only hope that every physician I will ever see in my lifetime has the same level of care, professionalism, compassion, and humanity that Dr Ma has shown my family. She is a shining example of what is missing in today’s medical care in America. ",Female
"Dr. Ma is the most compassionate and knowledgeable doctor I have ever had the privilege of seeing. Not only was she exceptional to my family during my mother’s sudden illness several months ago, but went out of her way to intervene and advocate on my behalf when I was recently admitted. Any family or patient should consider themselves very fortunate to be in the care of such a wonderful, warm and caring human being and physician. I wish I could rate her higher than 5 stars!",Female
"Dr Ma only seems to care about getting a patient out of the hospital regardless of their medical conditions. She; unfortunately; was assigned as the treating physician for my brother during his stay in the hospital. From the VERY MOMENT she was assigned to my brother she disagreed with the physician who admitted him and tried to do everything in her power to discharge him with a life threatening condition. She is cold, insensitive, I compassionate and should not be treating patients! ",Female
"DO NOT GO TO CAPITAL PEDIATRICS.
The most disturbing thing is, that they have known for NINE years that my kids are not vaccinated AND they didn't tell me when I made the appt with their pediatrician (from birth!), Dr. Helen Ma would refuse to treat them.  You don't get the right to refuse medical treatment of a CHILD. Parents who vaccinate should stop going to no-refusal doctors!  Maybe it will get them to obey their Hippocratic Oath once again.",Female
Dr. Ma is very compassionate.  He listens with an empathetic ear.  He provided me with thorough  information so that I could decide what was the best treatment for my prostrate cancer. I never worried about my illness because of Dr. Ma's engagement and encouragement.  I am doing very well for the last seven years.,Male
My husband and I have Dr. Ma as our primary Doctor. We both highly respect him. He never rushes us through an appointment and is very thorough and caring. He has never brushed off any health concerns that we have. I have seen other Doctors from the same office who are also very good but he is by far our favored doctor. We highly recommend him.,Male

Very caring physician who takes time to explain and answer questions of patient and family.  ,Male

"Can't get sick appts, they say go to urgent care, what's the point of having an established Dr.? Love Holly Rowe always request her! Got charged more for a longer appt. well, if you can't ask the Dr. Extra health Questions then what is the purpose???  She's knowledgeable but not the warmest bed side mannor ",Female
"Every time I attempt to go in for a doctor visit the appointments are scheduled so far out. If I call in with an urgent issue, why should I have to wait a week or later to be seen. I called in today in regards to severe abdominal pain, and the earliest I can be seen is seven days from today. No thank you. I will look for another primary care doctor  today!",Female
"Dr. Ma has been pretty disappointing so far. I asked her a question about PM2.5 and if newborns are considered a “sensitive” population, since occasionally there are warnings for poor air quality for sensitive groups. Dr Ma ROLLED HER EYES and answered “well, if you live around trees, trees make oxygen so...” What? I wasn’t asking about a lack of oxygen that’s ridiculous, I’m asking about a specific type of air pollutant that may or may not impact my newborn. The eye roll just made me angry. Anyway, another thing to consider is that she really struggles to be on time for any appointments. I really wish we could change but I’m not sure how to go about that.",Female
Always pleasant. She is very knowledgeable and thorough. ,Female
"I would definitely reccommed her. Professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant.",Female

It is extremely difficult to reach him upon flair ups. Sometimes it takes as many as 3 messages in 3 days to have him return a call. Makes it extremely difficult to receive continued treatment  started at Togus. At this point I am dumping him as my Rheumatologist in favor of Veterans Choice by civilian Dr's.",Male
"Once he asked how have you been I said I've been better he said better,that's good. So, now I just say I'm hurting. In his field no one is better. When he sees things outside of his field that need attention he still does all he can to fix the problem he's a very busy man but won't shoot you out the door to stay on schedule he'll stick with you until he's done all he can. Just wish he'd work on his English. He very nice very helpful knowledgeable in both eastern &amp; western medicine",Male
"I was found to have bladder cancer in Nov 2017. At our first visit, I asked Dr. Ma why having my bladder removed and a permanent ileostomy would be preferable to living without tubes and bags, and he replied “we could save your life.” I was in the hospital for 11 days. Dr. Ma visited every day. He asked questions and I asked questions, and then he would tell stories. It's been six weeks since my surgery. Dr. Ma saved my life and I feel great! and it WAS worth it! Dr. Ma is my hero.",Male
"Infection ensued after removal of the bladder/prostate/lymph nodes.  Second surgery needed to clean up the infection.  We subsequently learned from another doctor that a stitch had been left inside during the first surgery, probably causing the infection.  After the second surgery, the doctor did not stop by to see the patient, nor did he give any written directions to the post-oerative department for home care and treatment.",Male
First treated for a finger injury at ER. He spent less than a minute with me then sent a resident to stitch me up.  A week later I called for an appointment to have the sutures removed. It took a full week to get that appointment. The nurse removed them then sent in the Doc. He looked at it and muttered something incomprehensible to a guy taking notes. He told me to soak it in providing diluted to 9 parts sterile water. He left me with an orderly who said we were done and got up to leave. I stopped him and asked if they were going to bandage the wound. He checked with the Dr. And proceeded to open sterile gauze and take such he stuck to his jeans before bandaging. No gloves no washing hands. No written instructions. A week later (3 weeks total) and the wound is still weeping. Have a follow-up with a different Dr. Tomorrow.,Male
This doctor told me that my 2 fingers would not be numb immediately after surgery. I am 6 mo post op and my entire hand and all fingers and thumb are completely numb. Just what has this surgeon done to me??? I question the doctor and he acts like I was like this before the surgery. This man has damaged something else while doing my Ulna Nerve surgery. I have been in severe pain for 6 months and this doctor does not care. I am finding a new doctor who cares about this!!!,Male
This doctor told me that I will be in pain for the rest of my like. His exact words were: you don’t like being in pain that’s just the way it is. You can go to New York or anywhere and they will tell you the same thing. His bedside manner was terrible and he kept telling me as I’m crying that I’m upset but that’s just the way it is. I would not recommend him to any of my family members or friends. ,Male
"I suffered an amputation of my left middle finger at the distal joint.  While the joint itself was obliterated, he re-attached the end of my finger, allowing me to still be able to type normally, which is a large part of my job.  He saved my finger!  A brilliant surgeon, great doctor and very nice man!",Male
This doctor told me he could do nothing for me . He said the only thing I could do was never bend my arm again for the rest of my life . I am 30 years old !!! I would never recommend him to anyone ever!!,Male
"Dr. MA was professional, thourough with his patient history questions, and most important took as much time as needed by the patient to answer questions. He appeared knowledgeable on his field of neurology.",Male
Terrible experience. I drove over an hour to get to my appointment and it took me longer to park than I was in his office. He asked me questions that didn’t even pertain to my condition. He didn’t ask any questions and had horrible bedside manners. Recommended I see him again. Never going there again! Waste of time and money! ,Male
Very good.  Dr Ma was preceded into the room by his NP who took a detailed history and performed a thorough neurologic exam.  Dr Ma then reviewed that history with me using eye to eye contact while asking further questions.  He repeated some of the physical exam and added to it.  He explained his findings in understandable terms in an I rushed manner. He then shared his thoughts offering diagnostic options.  I found him to be kind and caring.  ,Male
"-Waited 20 minutes. Dr. Ma spent less than five minutes with me.
-Was told medication was causing my symptoms - I've been on it for two months to treat symptoms I've had for 4 years.
-Diagnosis was migraines - came in for constant muscle tremors and spasms, and don't HAVE migraines.
-Summary paperwork on leaving had instructions completely OPPOSITE of what he told me in exam room, and a pain reliever prescribed instead of the suppliment he told me i was getting.",Male
Very sweet and to the point,Male
He goes above and beyond for his patients. He called to check on me and didn’t charge me a phone visit like most would. Great bedside manner also.,Male
I found DR MA very informative and through. Answered all my questions in a professional and timely fashion. Would defiantly recommend.,Female
"Told us one story over phone which gave us some hope. Once in office face to face told a different, not so promising story. When trying to discuss this with her she was very defensive. We would like to report our experience to her superiors.

"My urologist suggested an initial consultation with Dr. John Ma to review the pros and cons of radiation therapy. He spent a half hour with me and sent me a bill for $491.00 My insurance company allowed $73.65, which I think was about right.",Male
"Dr Ma is the best!  I like doctors who don't try to fill me full of medicine but give me alternatives to improve my health.  He's thorough and well experienced.  I totally trust his judgement.  Only negative is he's only in Elkton office once a week and it takes a month to get in for a well visit.  If sick you take your chances on who you get or drive to Perryville, MD.  ",Male
"Excellent professionalism, medical knowledge and patience to listen, I felt I was in good hands. thus far.  Thanks for the opportunity to share, my experience.",Male
"I am thankful to have found Dr Ma.  He is very patient in office visits, very responsive to emails and phone calls fir in between visit needs.  His office staff is polite.  My only complaint is for a central service fir scheduling appointments and incoming calls makes it hard to talk directly with the office staff directly without a return call.",Male
I would beware of this doctor. All he’s looking for is money. The first thing he said before we even spoke about my condition is ‘I’m very expensive. You’ll need to pay me a lot. Do you want to see me or not?’. Would not be coming back to him- he is not trustworthy. Clearly the truly intentions are purely money related.  ,Male
"I have no knowledge about heart disease.  I had a heart attack risk about 5 months then I went to Dr. Ma.  He found My 2 main artery blocked 90%.

I had been to numerous doctors, orthopedics, chiropractors, had injections, physical therapy and various medications, with no consistent relief.

"Visited today after 4 mo wait for appointment for severe sleep disorder. Dreadful! She spent 5 minutes doing a ridiculously superficial interview, concluding that I suffer with insomnias and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome because of bad habits--entirely overlooking my long history of endocrine, neurological &amp; rheumatological illnesses.

"Cold, condescending, and dismissive. She spent 5 minutes with me, didn’t take the time to read the form I filled out in detail, pertaining to my history, didn’t even have x-rays taken (when there’s a radiology department in the building), or give me specific stretches to do after she told me, “You’re just really tight.” “So, why are you here to see me when you’re seeing all these other doctors? (with a smug face).”  Wow, Dr. Ma. That’s a great question why I chose to see you. I wish I hadn’t inconvenienced myself or you, for that matter, seeing as you seemed to be in such a rush. I have never written a bad review for a doctor in my life until today.",Female
"We used Dr. Ma for my daughter's follow up visit. She was so nice and very informative.

"Stay away at all cost. She did speak to me or my family after surgery. She gave me one prescription for pain before surgery and that was it I also couldn’t speak with her.

"I’m a medical professional myself and has been extremely picky especially when looking for doctors who will take care of me and my family. Dr Na-Chuang is one of the bests if not the best Doctor who delivered 2 of my babies and she knows her profession so well.Ive got 2 C-section delivery and with situations like those I’ve experienced during some issues with my labor, all I have to do is to trust Dr Na. I’ve been through so much but because she got the experience and good bedside manners and very caring demeanor, she made my pregnancy and my delivery at least a smooth sailing experience. I will definitely recommend her. I even am willing to pay for higher co-pays due to the recent insurance changes on my end just to see her. May God bless her more.

Then after that, there is someone who is more rude, and hang up my call while I am still talking and have question that I am not clear.  I  feel really bad to give up Dr. Na, just because I can't deal with her receptionist.",Female
"Dr. Na-Chuang is a great and caring doctor but her office is poorly managed. After leaving 4 messages to just make an annual checkup appointment, no one returns my call. Im not a new patient, seeing her for years!",Female
"Dr. Na is a wonderful, caring doctor who has always diagnosed and treated my problems properly.  The only drawback is that it difficult to make routine appointments with her.",Female

She is such a knowledgeable, caring and thorough doctor.  I explained my concerns and what I was experiencing and, after multiple eye measurements and exams were performed, she immediately assessed my situation and had a thorough plan of action to address my complications. She recommended starting off with the least invasive option first, then we would progress to other options if necessary to return my night vision driving capabilities and quality of life.  Dr. Naadi was very compassionate during the entire process. 

Additionally, I also just had my 1 month follow-up appointment and it was as good as an experience as the first.  I highly recommend Dr. Revathi Naadimuthu. She is a wonderful doctor.",Female

More importantly, my mother is very comfortable with Dr. Naai and has nothing but praises for him.  He is a wonderful doctor who truly cares about the welfare of his patients.",Male
"Does not listen.  Does not think what you know about your body means anything.  He will continue to push his regime, even when it is killing the patient.  Other doctors and nurses won’t speak up because Na’ai has seniority.  
This man is heartless, rude, and unfortunately still in practice.  ",Male
"Dr. Naake was the doctor on call the night I went into labor. I was trying for my second VBAC and was told the next day that if any other doctor had been on call things may have turned out differently. My uterus ruptured and after observing me he made the quick decision to get me back for an emergency c-section.

"Dr. Naalbandian  and his staff is great. I got an appointment within 2 days of insurance approval. He will take the time to talk to you and address your concerns.

Nothing but good things to say. He did a thorough exam &amp; I will have my results in about 10 days. Thank you Dr. Naalbandian.,Male
Dr. Doesn’t listen to issues and therefore does not offer any solutions or suggestions. Waste of time. ,Male
"My first visit he did all of the standard neurology tests and decided to put me on Topamax twice per day, and refer me to Dr. Zeibo for sleep apnea. After that, all he'd do was walk in, check my reflexes, say it looked good and walk out in less than 5 minutes. When I went in complaining that the Topamax wasn't working, causing me serious side effects and needed changing, HE REFUSED to do ANYTHING for me when I told him I couldn't do CPAP therapy for causing worse headache.

Thanks again to Dr. Naaman, and his great staff.  ",Male
"Request your chart from this doctor! You'll find it FULL of inaccuracies. He does not listen to his patient... in my case, on ONE page (3 paragraphs), he made 8 mistakes. Do you really want somebody treating you that can't get simple facts about your health/condition straight? Avoid him, if you can. Many patients, nurses and other doctors don't care for him, that says a lot to me! I was genuinely surprised when I saw he had ANY positive reviews, his bedside manner is severely lacking.",Male
"Unlike many doctors, Dr. Naaman makes sure patient's care is being covered in all areas. Is very friendly to patient and their family members.

Had to wait 48 hours for clearance to take ibuprofen after multiple calls. Days later, still migraines, after multiple messages, they tell me to go to ER. REALLY? Why did I waste my time with you?

Even though my primary care physician referred me, he said I shouldn't be there, essentially putting the blame on me for being there when all I did was listen to my doctor. He was not warm at all &amp; I did not feel listened to when I explained my situation. He made me feel not worth his time. When I left, I was in tears because I was in pain, looking for help &amp; was not supported by him at all. ",Male
"Dr. Naas is a awesome foot Podiatrist. I had Bunions on both of my feet and had surgery In march I’ve had little pain and would recommend anyone who is in need of bunions surgery to see one of the best surgeons. 
Thanks Dr.Naas You Are awesome!! ",Male
Wonderful doctor and human being. I’m very pleased with Dr.Naas. I highly recommend him as he was recommended to me. Overall experience was suburb.,Male
"Dr. Naas is a fine doctor.  At one time I could not walk because of callouses on the bottom of my feet.  He on slowly &amp; gently and then I could walk.  He is very courteous, kind. caring, intelligent, expeditious, an expert in his field. He never rushes one; he listens to what you have to say and takes time with you.  He has made my life so much better.

Dr. Naas is wonderful as are his nurses. ,Male
"This guy is an incompetent idiot.  If that were all, I’d be able to just move on and find another doctor.  Unfortunately, he also thinks he is God’s gift to medicine.  Cocky, snippy, and dismissive of you as a patient.  Not the doctor you want to trust your health with.  He’d rather seem right at your demise.  Find someone else.",Male
"Dr. Peter Naas  performed an EGD and colonoscopy on me this week; January, 2020.  He was extremely skilled.  Throughout the procedure, he explained  each action he took.  He was extremely thorough, and made sure he checked everything.  I have never experienced a more comforting procedure; and that cannot always be said. I was in very good hands.",Male
Go to a veterinarian before seeing this arrogant fool in a lab coat. I've had a chronic condition that has been successfully treated for 13 years and have Never received such incompetent medical treatment. GO TO SOMEONE ELSE!,Male
did great job with me very caring,Male
"Finally got answers and a direction for treatment from this caring doctor. He is not a conversationalist, but answers question directly in a way that I can understand the answers.",Male
"Dr. Naas is condescending and does not seem to care at all about his patients. He provided nothing but snippy remarks to my concerns and questions, and he did not provide any sort of plan during my visits. He wasted months by making me take multiple types of medication that did nothing, was reluctant to even get images of my abdomen, and I am no closer to knowing what’s wrong with me now than I was half a year ago. I do not intend to go back, and I would never recommend him.",Male
Horrible bedside manner ...arrogant...judgmental...everthing you don't want when you're sick ...would not recommend at all !! ,Male

"My experience was with my husband. Our 1st encounter was for Followup Colonescopy/Endescopy. Only a few polypes were found  and my husband was prescribed Immodium. On yet another visit to the ER , the doctor did an ultrasound and discovered gall stones and spots on his liver. Instead of trying to find out why my husband who is not a drinker had cirotic liver, all he harped on was watching his sodium. My husband was diagnosed with auto immune hepetitas that could have been treated if diagnosed in",Male
"Very condescending guy.  Comes across very arrogantly.  I'd find someone else, or find someone else in the practice.",Male
He took the time to listen to all of my issues and really seemed to care about my well being. He also made a great effort to find a treatment that was financially suitable for me ,Male
He is an excellent doctor! His nurse is amazing and goes about every and beyond! You can tell they really care about the well being of their patients! Highly recommend ,Male
"Arrogant doctor who is not interested in his patients but cares only about his mistaken belief that he, above all, is God's gift to his patients. He is rude, has no bed-side manner and evidences no interest in his patients difficulties. My opinion is that UCSF should not allow him to meet with patients without supervision from another doctor. He is incapable of listening to his patients and seems to believe he is smarter then his patients as he never asks patients about their symptoms. Avoid him",Male
"Kind, caring, intuitive, and patient with me and my partner through a very difficult situation. I recommend him highly. ",Male
"Saw him - he diagnosed my wife with dementia which we expected. He was arrogant, didn't listen. Bad bedside manner ",Male
"I switched to this doctor because of the reviews. I also liked the idea of a single doctor seeing you during the entire pregnancy and birth. However, shortly after switching, I noticed his horrible bedside manner and demeanor especially if you question him about his practice or if you disagree with his advice.  He is quick to dismiss your needs and cuts you off if you don’t agree with him. That is not the way you care for a patient. That is negligence. 
I think it may be time to retire.  I would not recommend this doctor after my experience. It is not safe!",Male
"A patient went in for a check up and requested advice for plan B and to receive a prescription to save money. Instead they were met with yelling, name calling, and plain derogatory language that no doctor should ever use towards a patient. Its no wonder that Raymond M. Naassana has received Zero Reviews for his business in the past 12 months",Male

One of the best doctors I have ever dealt with. ,Male
"Dr. Naassana is not my Ob/GYN, but he did deliver our baby! He is a WONDERFUL and amazing doctor. I was nervous about having him since he is not my provider, but I couldn't be happier that I did have him as our physician. He is very calming, thorough, and made our delivery experience amazing. Answers any and all questions in a very lay manner and he are just very happy with our care. I would definitely recommend him to others. ",Male
"Dr. Naasana is one of the best obgyn in Rochester. Very responsive, caring and experienced. ",Male
Doctor Nassaana is awesome. I like the personal response. I never had to speak to an answering service even when I called him 8n the middle of the night.,Male
"I am really surprised to see these negative reviews, to the point I’m wondering if I had a visit with a different Dr. Eric Naasz.

I have been a patient for a couple of months, referred to him by my family doctor to treat a foot injury and old ankle injury that needed a specialist.  
I have found everyone on his staff incredibly friendly and kind. I’m about 10+ office visits in and I’ve never waited more than 10 minutes to see the doctor. He is quick &amp; efficient in his time with his patients, I have never felt rushed or pushed out; in fact, he’s been very informative with the many questions I hit him with.
No issues with insurance billing, co-pays, prescriptions, etc. His staff represents his office well, friendly, efficient, effective.  I am very happy with the care and treatment (two surgical procedures and several office visits) I’ve received with Dr. Eric Naasz, I would certainly recommend him to family and friends.",Male
"Dr. Naasz has an unprofessional staff. He is rude and is only interested in money, not his patients.  Said I needed surgery.  Went to an orthopedic surgeon who said I shouldn't do surgery unless absolutely necessary.  He prescribed advil and the problem is gone! Also, said i needed orthotics.  600.00 dollars later I picked up orthotics that appeared to be no different than doctor scholls inserts from CVS.  He is a money grabber.  Beware!  He is unkind, disinterested and rude.  Treats people like they are hardly there.  Staff is rude or incompetent.",Male
Not a friendly place to visit. Dr. Naasz doesn’t seem to really care about his patients. I saw him 6 times for a foot problem. He looked at my foot the first time and never again. Just wrote prescriptions. He doesn’t look at your chart at all.,Male
Dr Naasz was very professional and made my surgery experience very easy to get through.  He was always patient and explained all being done.  I had a severe bunion surgery and he kept me calm through it all. Very knowledgeable and kind. Spends time with the patient no matter how busy the office is with each patient feeling important and not rushed .  I would return for any foot problems and recommend him highly.,Male
The experience with this Dr was very negative from the wait to see the Dr to the office staff.  Dr. Naasz also charged us extra instead of the copay which we subsequently had to call the insurance to get our money back.  The Dr. is quite arrogant and over charges for orthotics which he always recommends since he makes a huge profit.  DO NOT trust this Dr.,Male
"I was very unhappy with Dr. Naasz.  So I decided to have a second opinion.  This what I found out:
 1. I had two bone spurs NOT one

2, Dr. Naasz said I could only have surgery; general anesthetic and 4 weeks off of my foot. I found out removal could be as an outpatient and a local

3. I asked about a conservative treatment for the bone spur.  He said there wasn't one. 

4. He wasn't interested in talking to me and was in a rush

5. He is disrespected  to his staff and doesn't care who hears it",Male
"he's a talented surgeon that performed my foot surgery. his personality is dry and not friendly.  during post op exam,  he was squeezing and draining my foot. I screamed about it hurting, he didn't flinch nor did he seem to cared. ",Male
"If you are needing real answers and real help this is a poor choice.  While in the hospital came to my room did not introduce herself.  Stated I was in for something totally different, once I corrected her she looked at my chart.  Stated you look fine go home.  Is this what our health care has come too=?",Female
"I would highly recommend Dr. Naaz.

"Stay Away!  Very good bedside manor, but communication and Q &amp; A servery lacking.

Oh did I say treatment, she doesn't do that either, at least not for me.  

Going to another Neurologist ASAP.",Female
"Dr. Naaz is a great doctor. She listens to what you have to say. Regarding your lab work she will explain what each test result is and how to improve, so you can get a better result in your next lab results. She is not one of those doctors that is rushing to push you out of the door. ",Female
"Dr. Nazz is an extraordinary personality and she just acts like an immediate family member. She used to call us and enquire about my dad?s condition even though he was moved to a different hospital and under chemo. She is the best example to see and learn how a doctor should be. She is very helpful very present and very caring. My family and I are very thankful to Dr. Nazz for all the help, care and comfort she provided during the most difficult time in my life.",Female
Performed Mohs on my leg and I was very happy with the healing and the sutures! Always kind and answers all questions!,Male
He has a calm presence. ( and his assistants). First time having Mohs surgery on my forehead and  scary. Very responsive to my concerns- gentle too. He called me after I had a concern and gave me his email if I have any future questions. I’m a work in progress but so far so good- ,Male

I thought he listened to me and was very empathetic. ,Male
"Dr. Nabavi Diagnosed me with MDD, on my third appointment he said he never wanted to see me again. For him to abandon his patient is disgusting, knowing the risks associated with depression, he doesn't care about people.  I left him and found the will to finish my degree, and I got accepted into medical school and now I am a 3rd year medical student. I write this now because I just answered a question during lecture correctly, and the correct answer was NEVER abandon your px.",Male

"Wonderful staff and very professional , caring and personable Dr.   This is my second procedure at the Lima, Oh office and will return if anything further is needed.   Loved that not only the office called me

Dr. Nabavi performed a Blepharoplasty on both eyelids in August of 2018.  Everything went well and it was a good experience.  I was amazed when I could see so much better.

 He is very rude and has a God complex about them self. He has one of the most terrible bedside manner I have  seen in a Dr.  I would never let him do surgery again.

Very straight forward doctor.",Male
"The office staff is great and my first visit with Dr. Nabavi I felt went ok.  But the second visit, he never looked at my face, never review my test results with me in detail, told me I might have something else, and sent me out for yet MRI #4.  When I asked questions regarding my tumor the answer was we will see when the time comes.  For me you can't tell someone they either have MS or a spinal cord tumor and not answer their questions.  The second visit took all of 3 minutes.",Male
"If your doctor becomes unavailable, the office will NOT transfer you to another physician within the practice (the Institute of Brain and Spine Surgery) unless you have an emergency. In my situation, my case was abandoned completely; the office refused to schedule me with another surgeon, and I was never contacted again. Of note, I had suffered a serious neck injury, so it wasn't as if I had a minor matter. Also, the office looked like a hovel, and Dr. can't explain bone healing accurately.",Male

If I could leave 0 stars I would. Been dealing with cancer for a long time and this is the only Dr. I have ever had that I feel doesn't actually care.

Dr Naber Is a no nonsense doctor. He's direct and smart and and has taken care of me for over 20 years. Even during some difficult illness doc got me in line and would not relent until I was better.

"If you could rank 0 stars I would. In no way do I believe Dr. Nabar cares about his patients. If you tell him your symptoms, that you're not feeling well, or are having dizzy spells he will be too busy trying to see another patient to keep his billable hours high and will let you leave with no care if it is a serious issue. 

It is very hurtful to put trust into a doctor and have them be to consumed to provide you the care you need which can have severe consequences when you leave the office.",Male

He interrupted me and my mother several times--he does not have the ability to listen. In the middle of a sentence, he interrupted me with, ""cool, I'm a lawyer, too."" Okay, and I'm a Mensa member but what does that have to do with my health? It was only the urging of my mother that pushed him to call for an X-ray which showed us what the problem was. Ugh. ",Male
"This doctor cannot be reached  I came to the scheduled appointment, but he was no longer with the facility. I wasted my time because of this website outdated infirmation.",Male
"I came to know Dr. Naberesky when a friend was Villa Marie rehab center.  I live in another State and I found him to be caring, compassionate, informative, understanding, and genuinely concerned about the health of his patient.  It was a feeling of comfort knowing that someone with his demeanor was taking care of my friend.  He took his time to explain matters to me.  He never appeared rushed or put out with my constant calls or texts.  I wish we had him in our hometown.  He is a true gentleman.",Male
Love dr nab. Spends time. Follows up to make sure I am okay. Great office. ,Male
"Dr Naberezny is amazing. I feel like a child again when I'm at his office. He's very knowledgeable and caring, and spends time talking with me about ordinary life matters, like travel and culture. I would recommend him to my friends and family. My only issue is the wait time, but I assume this is because he's spending time with the previous patient as he does with me. ",Male
"In my opinion Dr Naberezny is the best doctor I've ever encountered.  I'm 75, so that is saying a lot.  He is easy to talk to and easy to understand.  He is very thorough and very knowledgable",Male
Dr Naberhaus has been my doctor since 1989. He is a very caring doctor and has a passion for his patients. He has helped me through many difficult times. He has treated both by  daughters and my oldest granddaughter. I have followed Dr Naberhaus every time he changed clinics.  God Bless you Dr Naberhaus.,Male
"Dr. Naberhaus is a very caring doctor who takes his time to listen to your concerns. A very patient doctor who has helped me so much after the loss of a family member. He is an amazing person who is a big heart and is a blessing in my life to be my Doctor.
God bless you Dr. Naberhaus ??",Male
"I would highly recommend Dr Naberhaus. He does not take medicare, however, so I need to find someone else. Im truly upset.",Male
We have been with Dr. Naberhaus for many years and would never think of going to any other medical office.,Male
"I have been with Dr Naberhaus for over 25 years.  He is one of the best.  He listens, he diagnoses, and then fully explains what the medical problem is and the procedure to correct the problem.  His staff, which has changed a number of times over the years, has always been professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.  

Although I live 2 hrs from his office I will continue to maintain Dr Naberhaus as  as my primary physician.

I highly recommend Dr Naberhaus.",Male
"This guy is an absolute embarrassment to Gulf Breeze Hospital. Bought my wife into the ER with known repetitive issues with a herniated diaphragm. Instead of giving her medication to help with the vomiting and severe pain, he drilled her about not following up with a surgeon. He put her gastric doctor down, and made us feel like absolute garbage. I made a comment about his behavior and he had me removed from the hospital by security like I was a threat to him. This guy’s practice isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.  Be very aware of this guy if he is on staff at any facility he is doing shift work. He will treat you like a piece of gum under his shoe. Ask any employees who work at Gulf Breeze Hospital. Nobody has anything good to say about this guy",Male
"Rude &amp; condescending. In spite of explaining I was in pain, feeling awful, vomiting for 24 hours, and dehydrated I was treated like a burden. There were multiple beds open in the ER, so there's no excuse for his rudeness.",Male
No compassion whatsoever. Treated us like we were stupid for coming to ER. Rudest doctor I’ve ever seen. ,Male
He is truly awful ,Male
"Had to go to the ER , Baptist in Gulfbreeze, checked in fine, have Cigna's top plan, he does not accept it got hit with a monster bill. ",Male
"Having to go to the ER is never fun, but Dr. Nabers really went above and beyond taking care of my mother! I've had other ER doctors who we barely saw the face of, but Dr. Nabers was great with communicating and helped us during a very difficult time! Highly recommend him!",Male
"Just turn and run the other direction far, far, away from this Dr.",Male
"If it wasn’t for Dr. Nabers.  I wouldn’t be here right now writing this review.  I had a very bad accident 5yrs ago.  I was sent to UAB due to my head injury.  I had also suffered a very large laceration on my upper left leg, which was stitched up in the ER before sending me to UAB the next day because the person who read my Head CT did not see the fractured skull and two brain bleeds.  While I was at UAB they did not assign a wound care specialist.  Even though I repeatedly asked them to check the large laceration.  They discharged me several days later after repairing my left ankle which required a titanium plate and 8 screws.  Upon returning home my stitches became infected and torn out.  I had developed MRSA.  I went back to the hospital.  Dr. Hugh Nabers was assigned my case.  It took three debridement surgeries and a skin graft he and Stephanie Lee the Wound Care Specialist saved me from having to have my leg a mutated at the hip.  I owe my excellent care to him and Ms. Stephanie",Male
"Dr Nabors did my surgery last week. May 23,2019 He has a very caring attitude when it comes to his patients. He had a great knowledge about the procedure he preformed. If i ever had to have surgery again I would definitely go to him. I highly recommend him for your surgical needs",Male
Love this doctor. .So nice and caring. .I have personally used him and recommended him to others. Several of my family members has used his services also. Never heard anyone say anything negative about him.,Male
Was condescending and rude. Seemed annoyed with questions and didn't want to take the time to answer them.,Male
Dr. Nabert’s demeanor is rude and condescending.,Male
"He recommended a stent but did not meet with me at a scheduled appointment to discuss this.  I changed doctors, found out my blood flow was normal and that I did not need a stent nor Catheterization.  That was 7 years ago.  Not trustworthy.  Do not see this doctor.",Male
"First visit and not really impressed with bedside manner at all. A know it all doc, and I detest those kind.",Male
Dr. Nabert is always late seeing you from 45 minutes to one hour.  I respect him and his knowledge but he has a dry personality.  The check in and out staff is something to be desired.  Just not much  kindness in their voices.  The Medical Assistant was very kind and was smiling.,Male
My impression of Dr. Nabert over several years is that he is extremely competent and has excellent patient skills.  When I was looking for ablation for AFib he very carefully explained why it was not a good idea in my particular case.  He has provided me with first rate cardiology follow-up.  I would recommend him to family and friends and particularly to Veterans as he seems particularly sensitive to our service-related issues.,Male
"If not for the billing, it was a good visit.  Three weeks after my visit, received a bill for the lab work he had done.  Turns out, ALL of the lab work was out of network even though my insurance normally covers lab work and is the largest insurer in the state of Georgia, BCBS.  No warning by the office at all.  Just a bill for $900 for routine lab work(cardio stress test).  Make sure you ask specifically if everything little thing they do is covered by your insurance.",Male
He gives excellent explanations and is up on the latest information. Great bedside manner.,Male
He saved my mother life.  He came in on a weekend and fixed my moms slow heart ,Male
"The patient was clean, well groomed, no bugs,  no contagious diseases to the best of our knowledge so why not even a simple stomach feel/palpitation to aid diagnosis?  When someone has been bedridden for a month and has no job or insurance during a pandemic but is paying you cash money  - you can't be bothered?",Male
"I went in for a routine Colonoscopy and had the best experience. The entire staff, the Dr. Nabh, Susan the nurse and Le the anesthesiologist were all wonderful. I left fully coherent and Dr. Nabh explained everything to myself and my husband. I would highly recommend him to anyone needing a Gastro Dr.",Male
"Everything before and during the Friday mid day telehealth visit went very well.  I didn't realize until later that evening that one of the meds prescribed was very similar to one I already take so I sent a patient portal message asking if I should take both the new and old or just the new. I also asked why the prescriptions had not been sent to my pharmacy. As of the following Tuesday, there has been no response from the doctor regarding the new vs old med. The prescriptions were finally sent to the pharmacy on Monday, 3 days after the doctor visit. No response from the doctor re the medicine duplication after 4 days (2 working days) is unacceptable.",Male
"Excellent doctor with an awesome staff so polite, always a real person speaks  to you and takes care of all your needs ASAP with return calls! Dr Nabh is compassionate and explains things perfectly with ample time. He is very sweet and thorough. Very happy! ",Male
Dr Nabha has been a god send for my husband. Dr Nabha always acts as if he is happy to see my husband and explains his medical situation in detail and is never in a hurry. He has helped my husband through dialysis and a kidney transplant in 2012. My husband looks forward to his twice yearly appointments with Dr. Nabha. We highly recommend Dr Nabha to anyone with kidney issues.,Male
He is knowledgeable and very considerate.,Male
"Dr. Said Nabhan's expertise goes beyond perfect. His professional appearance, bedside manners are of the utmost. He reassures the patient will not feel anything, and he was 100 % right. I had a colostomy preformed on March 14, 20016. I would highly recommend him for a very important upkeep of health. What a gentleman!",Male
Explains everything and very patient. ,Female
"I like Dr Nabhane. She is very nice, professional and thorough. She was very helpful to me with my problem. I found her to have a good sense of humor, as well.",Female
"Extremely conscientious, skilled, caring. Will pull no punches about your condition and how to have best life. You will need to change your lifestyle. Doh. Highly recommend. ",Female
"By far, the most conceited, condescending doctor I've ever met. She was not familiar with the condition I was concerned about, but when I tried to explain the causes and symptoms, she told me to stop talking because ""You're not a doctor."" She didn't listen to anything I had to say. True, I'm not a doctor, but I'm not complete idiot either. I do have extensive medical training. The appointment took over 90-min and was a total waste of time. Good thing I had nothing else to do that afternoon.",Female
She was very conscientious about patient confidentiality.  Plus she was really nice to talk to.,Female
"My experience with Dr Nabi was a great success (he repaired my aneurism on my aorta).
I think the Doc can walk on water.",Male
Dr. Nabi is an excellent physician with great bedside manner. He performed two vein ablations for me and took excellent care of me pre and post procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Nabi for any vascular needs.,Male
"Extremely professional, straight to the point and made sure I understood everything. I love that he came in right away and talked to me and asked all the questions himself (as opposed to have a nurse do it and just showing up at the end). He is ver knowledgeable and definitely knows what he’s doing. Wish all the practitioners were like him. ",Male

"Dr. Nabi has been able to restore circulation in my husband's leg-and is doing the same procedure on his other leg soon.  Dr. Nabi is both thorough, and conservative in deciding the best treatment choice for the problem. We highly recommend him!",Male
Dr. Nabi was very kind. I was misdirected to his office and he gave me a referral to the specialist I needed. He also called right after to give me the contact information for the doctor.,Male
Positively,Male
Wonderful and caring Doctor,Male
Very professional and reassuring.,Male
"I would not recommend this urologist to anyone. I seen him for 15 minutes. He wouldn't allow me to get a word in, and diagnosed me incorrectly. I went to the ER the following day, and they confirmed I was misdiagnosed through a sonogram.",Male
 Nurse  and doctor are great!!,Male
"I had a vein ablation done in early January. My leg was a gross, red, itchy mess, with a wound that wouldn't heal. Between this procedure and treatment from a wound care specialist, my leg feels great save for some occasional itching, and I was able to take a planned vacation to Disney World in Florida and hike around all those parks with no discomfort, and hit the resort pools. The leg still looks kinda creepy - Dr Nabi said the procedure probably wouldn't fix the ugly - but I feel great. ",Male
This physician ruined my legs.  I went to see him for my varicose veins.  He injected my legs and caused me to get a blood clot that put me in the hospital.  I would never recommend him to anyone and I would absolutely avoid being treated by him.  ,Male
Dr. Nabi is extremely thorough in his evaluation as well as explanation of the available treatment options.  We immediately felt total confidence in him.   ,Male
"From the time I checked in to the time I checked out, it was 30 minutes.  Dr. Nabi took care of me with efficiency and a caring attitude, he ordered tests for me and prescribed medicine and he fixed  my problem  in a timely matter with excellent care. His staff is very friendly and they make you feel taken care of and they are very efficient as well.",Male
"Dr. Nabi was prompt, efficient, very knowledgeable and I didn’t have to wait an hour to see him like some doctors. He listen to my problem, ordered the appropriate tests, medicated me and fixed my problem. I would very much recommend him as a urologist, especially since I was in and out of the office in 30 minutes.",Male
"She is very rude and short with patients. I believe she knows what she’s doing, but my mom is a quiet person. Nabi can be very intimidating, which leaves my mom from asking questions. I would never recommend her.",Female
Dr. Nabi has a unique combination of intelligence and compassion. Trust her with your medical needs. ,Female
Dr. Nabi is a caring physician and listens to you when you speak.,Male
"Dr. Nabi has been my physician since 1978. He is compassionate, efficient and possesses a wealth of medical knowledge and expertise. I trust him implicitly.",Male
"Never had any doctor more caring or more knowledgeable than Dr. Nasser Nabi. I've trusted him with my life ever since the first day that I met him. Wonderful bedside manner, kind, thoughtful, instructive. ",Male
"I went to the office on Main Street as a new patient. I was put in a room and advised Dr.Nabi would be in shortly. I sat in the room for 30 minutes without even a nurse or employee coming in to let me know they are backed up and apologize for the wait. I went to the receptionist counter to advise I have been sitting in that room for 30 minutes without the doctor and all she could say is ""he is in other procedures, but you're next"". I expressed that not even a single person came in to let me know he was backed up and just let me sit there waiting. I asked her if she knew how long until it was my turn and she said no but you're next. I told them they can keep their $50 bucks and left.
The office is unprofessional. Clearly they don't care about their patients because if they did they would have come in the room after about15 minutes to let me know they were backed up. But no, they left me in the room to just sit and wait for literally nothing.  
Not even worth the 1 star but you have to.",Male
I do not recommend  dr. Nabi. He was very rude and disrespectful. I was allergic to the medication he prescribed and he refused to prescribe a different one. His staff are just as rude. The one told me I would die if I didn't take what he prescribed. ,Male
Dr Nabi totally misdiagnosed me and was arrogant and didn't listen to my concerns. He made me feel like my concerns were not valid at all. I ended up being diagnosed with Menieres Disease by two other Doctors. Dr Nabi never took me seriously. The staff is really nice but he is not. ,Male
"I'd been a patient of Dr Nabi for 20 years or so. My family was also referred by me. WE've all had excellent care. You may have to wait in his busy office, but he doesn't rush when it's your turn. He listens and cares. What more can you ask?",Male
"The doctor is arrogant and gets offended when patients ask questions. He actually yelled at me in front of his staff. I had a medical condition that was new to me, so I was asking questions to help myself. he takes it as questioning his authority. He also insults his patients with codenames. If he thinks a patient is stupid, he will tell his staff that he needs his ""Monkey Juice"", which seems to refer to a drink to help him deal with stupid people. He said this about me as I stood right there.",Male
Great experiences with thyroid and septum surgery,Male
"Dr Nabi is very professional, courteous, and friendly.  She fully understands her job and cares about her patients.  The staff are very caring and friendly.",Female
"Every visit, Dr. Nabi is professional and clear about my problem!  She is very caring and patient.  I love, also, her staff!  They have the same qualities as she.  The last time I needed an iron infusion, I was taken into the hospital directly to a cubical for the procedure.  Dr. Nabi, then, saw me and voiced her concerns.  It's always a pleasant experience!",Female
"Ty for renewing my lantz ,,,John Keller",Female
Literally destroyed my life. Avoid at any price,Female
Dr Nabieva is a wonderful doctor. I feel that  she cares about me and my children. Very satisfied with my children  care.,Female
Dr Nabieva is a wonderful psychiatrist. She actually listens; my children feel comfortable in her office and look forward for the visit.,Female
"She is not professional. She asked inappropriate questions regarding my divorce while I was present in a portion of my adolescent son's session. She asked ""who wanted the divorce?"" in front of my son and also asked questions regarding our financial arrangement while my son was present. She did not apologize when I brought it up but defended her position. Her staff is rude, disorganized and uncommunicative. I have had to leave multiple messages and send emails before questions are answered.",Female
"I cannot comment on Dr. Nabieva’s skills, as thanks to the front desk and insurance verification stuff, our appointment was wrongfully cancelled even though we are in network. We waited one month for this much needed appointment. During the 30 min after I received the cancellation notification, I was able to verify with my insurance that in fact we are in network. The stuff gave away our long waited spot on the schedule and commented that they were too busy to verify my insurance again.",Female
"Dr. Nabili is the best! 
I went in to see him for a consult, I had just broken my nose two days prior. 
He explained to me what his best recommendation was, a closed nose reduction, and didn’t second guess that I had came to the right Dr. 
You can tell Dr. Nabili truly cares about his patients.
He explained all parts of the procedure, thoroughly, before and post op as well. 
Had some questions over the weekend and got back to me on a Sunday morning, making sure everything was all good. 
I highly recommended Dr. Nabili to all my family and friends and to everyone reading this reviews as well.",Male

"Foundation Neurology put in the wrong billing code twice an EMG test. I have medical reimbursement that would have paid the deductible they billed of over $300 had the billing office submitted the bill right the first time. It took almost 8 months for them to get the adjusted bill and never contacted us that this issue was occurring until we randomly received the bill in the mail.  They have been extremely rude, unhelpful and treating us as if we did something wrong. Stay away!",Female
"He was not very compassionate after I had two miscarriages and did not want to refer me to an RE, even though it's what I ultimately needed. I would not recommend him for anything fertility related.",Male
"Very helpful. Explained things very well! Actually figured out my problems unlike other doctors ive been to. Very intelligent, accurate on diagnosis, professional. I would recommend him to anyone i know!",Male
"I have been going to this amazing Dr Nabity for nearly twenty years. He is very concerned and very knowledgeable about women's health.

Dr Nabity is the Best Pain Specialist! I've been seeing him since 2012. When I first started seeing him I was spending more time in bed as my pain was so bad and couldn't do many things. I feel he has given me quality of life as I'm not spending most days in bed. I'm out enjoying the little things in life. He's a very caring doctor and also his assistant Brad is great too. I remember the first injection I received I felt like a million bucks! The office staff is wonderful too.,Male
"I want to say that Dr Nabiity has been one of the most wonderful doctors that I have ever encountered. He actually listens and is very respectful. He has never made me feel like he was rushing me out of the office, like my issues weren't important to him. And yes I would recommend Dr Nabity to my family and friends.

Recently, after being told after a breast ultrasound that I should wait and have it redone in 6 months, Dr. Nabizada, because of my history, insisted that I see a surgeon right away. Long story short, I am undergoing treatment for invasive breast cancer now. Thank you, Dr. Nabizada, for being pro active in my care.",Female
"She is easy to talk with, listens to your concerns and offers solutions or ways to go forward with a health plan",Female

"This Dr. Delivered our first baby, Bella. What a wonderful experience that was, as wonderful as birth would seem, it truly truly was. We plan on all our of our future children being delivered by Dr. Nabizadeh. We had no complaints what so ever.

We recommend him to anyone looking for a phenomenal Dr. Five stars is just not enough.",Male

Dr. Nabizadeh is absolutely wonderful. She put me at ease during a stressful pregnancy; she is compassionate and funny; and she always listened to and addressed my concerns.,Female
"There’s no guessing since after the initial interview you have several blood tests that report on your well-being.  With this fact-based knowledge in-hand, Dr Nabizadeh guides you through affordable steps that start you returning yourself to better health.
I found Dr Nabizadeh from one of my other doctors and am not only pleased with my first meetings with him, I’m taking the needed supplements and very much looking forward to great results from implementing fact-based nutritional testing.",Male
"I became acquainted with Dr. Nabizadeh while in rehab. He has won me over. I have a whole new respect (long overdue) those health care providers. It takes a lot to tolerate ornery people during recovery and while most nurses and technicians are gifted caregivers that have genuine empathy, the tone is set by the physicians example.
Dr. Nabizadeh has the amazing gift of being able to access and disarm the stress of a situation. Communication that a patient can understand is the best medicine.",Male
Dr. Nabizadeh is an amazing and caring doctor. We wish all doctors were as wonderful as he is!!,Male

I trust him 110% even with things that are not his specialty as he cares about the whole patient.  He does not perform surgery as he would rather work with you one-on-one as a person.  He has always been there when I've needed help or have a question. He has the best bedside manner of any doctor I've ever had.  I've heard about 'the long wait' from others, but all I've ever experienced is his willingness to take the time to answer all my questions and I never feel like he is trying to either push me out the door faster than I can move or he is trying to leave as soon as he enters the room; I never feel rushed.  Any doctors he has referred me to always speak about their utmost respect about him &amp; his craft but, most important he knows all there is about his specialty.   I fear the day he decides to retire.",Male

He noticed by looking arbitrary me that my thyroid was enlarged.He also takes his time with each patient, worth the wait to me. He has also, diagnosed &amp; treated my numerous neurological conditions. He is a caring person.I have been with him over 10 years and pray he doesn’t retire soon.Dr. N is amazing, I can’t say enough about him.",Male
Not as sharp as before.Needs better staff.,Male
The best! I gave up on Neurologists until a nurse practitioner in a care clinic convinced me to give him a chance and thank God I did. I had a very large brain tumor. Other doctors never listened to me when I knew something was different than my average migraine. He REALLY LISTENS to you. He remembers you as an individual not just a patient. He's very intuitive as well. I would be terrified if I had to switch doctors. Been his patient for four years now.,Male
"I have been seeing Dr. N for over 3 years.  He spends as much time is needed with ALL of his patients. He goes over test results, MRIs, etc and shows you exactly where the trouble lies.  Not only is he a thorough neurologist, he is also a caring man.  He has ordered and performed many tests and procedures on me to help get the issue resolved.  I have the highest regard and trust for him and I'm glad I am one of his patients.",Male
"Wonderful, caring, man. Spends all the time you need. Looks at you as as a doctor, not just a specialist. Leaves no stone unturned.  Don't mind the long wait time when a doctor will spend an hour with you.",Male
Listens well and works with you.,Male
"Not good!  It is about our brother.  He failed to tell my brother that he needs to see him after a week to follow-up after getting radiation, to see if there was a side effect on the radiation treatment.   We told him that my brother was getting sick and feeling very weak.  Dr. Nabong sometimes, let his assistant see us instead of him.  He did not show concern on what was going on with my brother.  Dr. Nabong failed to constantly check on my brother.
The way we were treated, very discriminating with patient who was dying. 
Being my brother's POA, i regret that I agreed on this doctor's recommendation.  My brother became so ill during the radiation, lost a lot of weight, and the cancer spread/mestasized.  Before getting this radiation, my brother was okay, he had good appetite, he ate well, and according to the medical records, his surgeon who operated him, his cancer did not mestasized.  The radiation was recommended by this oncologist.  
The family give him just zero star.",Male
"Dr Nabong was the oncologist of my brother who was diagnosed of stage 1 pancreatic cancer. After the surgery he failed to follow up on the status of his condition. He left his office assistant to communicate with us . He was too busy it seemed on more patient more money. 
So if you are making a decision to find the right Oncologist for you or your love one. You may want to look for someone who is compassionate, caring to his patients and most of all excellent to his profession. He has a phony to zero compassion. To him cancer is death . Why bother attitude!",Male
"We took my mother to see him about 15 yrs ago. It was thought she may have had Multiple Myeloma. Fortunately, she did not. Dr. Nabong is expert in his field &amp; I was struck also with his kindness &amp; caring. I would highly recommend this doctor.  5 stars? Absolutely!",Male
"She's the best pediatrician I've found for my lo and I vetted many. She's very friendly,very helpful,and takes her time to listen to your questions and concerns.  She also doesn't rush with you so you feel very much like a part of the family! Best pediatrician hands down!",Female
"The most amazing doctor out there. Wouldn't take my kids anywhere else. She is caring, understanding, and knows how to do her job. The staff is amazing and you can almost always get in right away when an emergency strikes and you don't want to go to the hospital. I have been bringing my kids here for 7 years now and even though I now live on the other side of town, I will always make the the trip to bring them here.",Female
"First, the staff is lazy and ruining this doctor's business.   I was told this practice opens at 10:30am (which is late in itself).  I called to make an appointment and kept getting the answering service till 11:30am!!!!  When I FINALLY got a hold of the receptionist, she told me they were busy.  Really?!  You are OBLIGATED to have your phones on at the time you claim to be open.  Next, the receptionist then was prying asking what was wrong with my husband.  She is NOT the doctor and it's NONE of her business!  She then got huffy with me when I asked her what their hours are since I tried calling for over an hour. 

I will NOT go to this doctor because of the lazy nosy unprofessional staff",Male
He's a breath of fresh air that shoots it straight. Highly recommended!,Male

"Dr. Nillas was our pediatrician for our daughter starting in March 2012, and was the most caring and compassionate doctor I've ever met. she was always exactly right on what out daughter needed, and always made sure that I was doing okay as a new mom with post-partum depression. We moved to another city when our daughter was 8 months old, and I wish we could've brought her with us.",Female
Saved my hand in an intense 3-hour ER procedure.  My life could be very different today if it weren't for his help.,Male

I love Dr. Nabors.  She listens carefully to your concerns and never makes you feel rushed.  She takes all information into account and doesn't rush to prescribe unnecessary medications which is very important to me.  She explains situations well and presents you with options that best suite your lifestyle.  She's witty and very personable.  Her staff is also very kind and compassionate.,Female
Dr Nabors is amazing.  She has a real knack for making you feel comfortable and for finding out ways to help.  I never feel rushed with her like I’m just checked off her list.,Female
"I was 15-20 minutes late due to an accident on the interstate. They worked me in shortly after I arrived. I really appreciated not having to re-schedule since I had to leave work to be there. 
Dr. Nabors is a great doctor and she has a good sense of humor, which makes it  a pleasant visit.",Female
"I really cannot give an evaluation as she refused to honor my appointment.  Apparently, I was booked into a current patient slot and when they discovered I was a new patient, they refused to see me and said I would have to reschedule.  I explained I had driven an hour, taken off work and the error was theirs, not mine.  I requested that the staff ask the doctor to see me.  I was informed that this was not the way they did business, and she would have to approve me as a patient before I could be seen.  I told them to remove me from their files, and I would find a doctor that wanted to provide care to their patients - which I have.  I am a healthcare professional myself - I know that healthcare does not have to be administered this way and should not.  I understand the need for more time for a new patient, but common sense and empathy should prevail when appropriate.",Female
Dr Nabors is a great  health care doctor. I am very happy that I have Dr nabors as my health care provider.  She is the best.  Thank you very much!!!!,Female
Dr. Nabors has been my doctor for a number of years and I just love her!!!!! She is very honest and open with you about your concerns.  She listens and she's caring.  I am so glad I went to her.,Female

"Dr. Nabors is a kind , smart, and compassionate woman who truly cares about the needs of her patients. She does a thorough investigation into your complaints before she prescribes any actions that you made need for treatment. I just wish she could have remained in the Tupelo area. she is the best doctor you will ever see.",Female
Saw Dr. Nabors for the first time today. She was extremely thorough and very compassionate. I have been looking for a good doctor for quite a while. She will definitely be my new family practitioner.,Female
"I have been a patient of Dr. Nabors for several years. She is an excellent PCP and I highly recommend her! ?? It is very hard to find a GOOD, compassionate, caring doctor who has the patient's best interest at heart.... Dr. Nabors is this physician! ",Female
Been going to Dr Nabors for 14 years... wouldn't have any other family Dr. She has help me through so many things. Great Dr. And her staff I'd great!,Female
"A doctor is only as good as their support system. Today's doctors are overbooked, leaving their staff to operate at an improper pace. This then leaves the patient with poor care. This unfortunately isn't an isolated situation. Sad. ",Female
"I will never go back to this office. I'm currently suffering from a migraine and can't get my meds refilled due to negligence and nonsense. They make you come in to be seen for stuff that can and should be handled over the phone. I have 4 children and it isn't easy for me to go in, but they don't ever care. Also way too many billing issues. Doing extra stuff without discussing the cost with me. I need a doctor who cares about me as a whole, not just getting paid for me to visit.",Female
Dr. Nabors is an outstanding medical Dr. We have been in her care for over 5 years and will take as much time as you need with your visit. She listens and truly cares about her patients.. We recommend her to anyone that crosses our path.,Female
"Seriously Consider Seeing Someone Else.  I didn't come in on a deathbed stretcher so he didn't take me or my issues seriously.  Said I had nothing wrong.  I pushed for an MRI.  Two weeks later he's more receptive.  My MRI report stated I have 3 Herniated and 3 Bulging discs.  Doc, thought  you said I had no problems, can I get some anti-inflammatories.  He said yes, but when I picked them up, he prescribed half the dosage we discussed.   I read his reviews and took a chance.  If you're still reading this, Seriously Consider Seeing Someone Else.",Male
"Didn’t even get past the phone call to meet the Dr. I called left a message to make an app...nobody called me back...So I called again...only to get hung up on by some miserable older woman. Would never go there based on that. Reading the other reviews...maybe they’re all just arrogant, miserable people.",Male
"When he walked in to ""greet me"" his words and tone stunned me. It took me a minute to gain my speech. I then asked if he was ok, or if anything was wrong? Why I mistakenly stayed and communicated to him like you would to a doctor I don't know?....anyway he looked at my shoes while I talked and few times I almost just excused myself since I was clearly wasting his time (longest 3minutes of my life, like the twilight zone) eventually he said try PT (which I have for 14 years). WOW!",Male
"Single momom with ruptured disc I couldn't be outhere for a surgery for long. Dr nabors saw, diagnosed me and did my surgery all with in a week or so. He's an excellent doctor and I think if someone sees him as arrogent it's really the fact he is very good at what he does and highly educated, so he dos't need to sit and debate the course of action he needs to take. I'd rather. Have a doctor who is efficency and fixe's me than a doctor who is cordial worried about making friends and bad at his jo",Male
"The man is arrogant. Didn't look at my MRI or Xrays. Treated me like I was an inconvenience to him. I got up &amp; left.

Personally, I wouldn't send an enemy to him.",Male

Highly Recommended Physician. Fantastic Doctor and Family Oriented Doctor. He's been my doctor for over 20 years and has also been my mothers doctor for over 20 years and has been very proactive in our care and Very Compassionate with our care. He has been just wonderful in helping me with my mother to whom I cared for over 10 years who passed away from Parkinson's Disease last year.  He went above and beyond to make my mothers suffering from a tragic disease as comfortable as possible for her. Thank You Dr. O'Brien for all the wonderful compassionate years of care for my family.,Male
"Does not return calls timely, does not refer to specialists when it is necessary. More worried about things that are not important rather than serious health issues. Is not pro-active in preventing issues.",Male
My sister has requested her records from dr O’Brien’s office.  It has been two weeks and the receptionist said the request is still sitting on his desk ...waiting to be ok’d....this is unacceptable and wonder as to why my sister continues to wait.  Why is he stalking sending them as she is entitled to her own records....so why is it taking so long????  I have to wonder.,Male
"Excellent patient care.  Thorough, and willing to spend the time to make his patients well informed.  I recommend him to family, friends, and others as your primary care for families.",Male
"I am so happy that my cardiologist recommended Dr. O'Brien when I was looking for a new Dr.  He also treats my husband.  He always has time for you, answers all your questions, advises you on health matters.  ",Male

"Easy to talk to, and very thorough explaining my health",Male
"I called to ask if a certain doctor still holds office at this certain clinic. The secretary was very rude. Her name was MARY. She told me that she was tired of giving out that certain doctor's number and that I should write it down. Mind you, this is the first time that I called their office and that was the initial reaction I got from that rude secretary. Called a few times again to tell her she was rude but she kept on hanging up. PLEASE CONSIDER LOOKING FOR ANOTHER QUALIFIED SECRETARY.",Male
A very ignorant and non compassionate Dr. I would never recommend this Dr. to anyone . ,Male
"He didn't call me back regarding my elderly father's visit with him as I had noticed something that could be serious. I left 4 messages within a 24 hr period. The next day he returned MY FATHER'S call &amp; then I talked to him. He said he didn't get back to me because he was busy!  That is a weak excuse.  He kept telling me he didn't know why something was going on with my father. Didn't bother to say ""come back in and let's take a look"" or even offer to refer us to someone. Unprofessional.",Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. O'Donoghue's for over 30 years.  She's professional, patient, answers all my questions, and actually has a great sense of humor.  Sometimes the wait times are ridiculously long, but  I've learned to live with that.",Female
I have been a patient of hers for over 25 years. She is excellent and I highly recommend her.,Female
I have been a patient of Dr. O'Donoghue's for over 15 years and have been seen by her five times. She is professional and a brilliant diagnostician. Her tendency is to be perfunctory but will indulge you with as much time as you require to have all your medical conditions explained and your questions answered. I have referred family and friends to her; all were completely satisfied and have remained loyal patients of hers.,Female
"I had bad experience with my foot pain treatment. During my first visit, I was incorrectly diagnosed and treated with medicine that were not effective even after I took those medicines for a week based on his Rx. The pain got worse. Later during the followup visit I was not told the exact reason of why the pain and swelling is still there. It got worse and without any explanation   I was given some pain blocking medicine in the foot. Not to mention I got a hefty bill for both the visits. Not only I got charged for the follow up visit, but my pain got worse.",Male
"He preformed a surgery on my moms both feet, my mom had pain on both feet but not as painful as right now when he preformed the surgery, he told my mom that her toe on both feet were growing to the extreme that they were going to bend it was unnecessary because it runs in the family now my mother can’t feel her toes and she’s disabled from work it ruin her life Her pain is worst each day!

"he was an expert witness who said my foot was ruined 1st surgery due to deviating from standard of care. he was very adamant about it. screw 2x length should of been. big toe sticking up,too much bone cut.he worked where the dr. doing corrective surgeries.saw my records gave an attorney for lawsuit.7 surgeries 13.5 mo. he stalked me,etc.surgeon submitted false medical record 1 pg.handwritten. he reversed his conclusion on a lie,which he knew. payback for denying his advances. no honor integrity.",Male
Dr. O'Malley has always been kind and professional. The girls that work there are always friendly and caring. I have been seeing him for about 25 years and he has never made me feel uncomfortable discussing my concerns.,Male
Said oops as he was doing the procedure pain was inflicted,Male
"I received the news from Dr O’Malley that my baby had died in utero and my pregnancy was no longer viable. His compassion and professionalism made one of the hardest days of my life a tiny bit more bearable. He took his time explaining what likely occurred, patiently allowed me to cry, and assured me repeatedly that it was a common occurrence and by no means my fault or the result of anything I’d done. On the day of my D&amp;E procedure, he stopped to see me and check to see if I had any questions before the procedure. I was grateful for the care he took to ensure that I was physically and emotionally okay.",Male
I went for an Hpv flare up. I was positive of. He said it was a skin tag. Demanded the name of original oncologist who diagnosed me. 3 months later I had to have surgery with another dr. I was left in O'Malley room 34 min. Whole entire time he  spoke about storm Jonas chocolate cake and some good patient he had .  I moved to Pa and struggled with medical care there so I move back to Ca.  please don't go see Dr. Mally. I could have been diagnosed with cancer. Hpv is nothing to mess with.,Male
Dr. Omalley is a great. ,Male
He does not want to talk to you.  He thinks he can read your mind.  When you offer your health history he could care less.  He acted like he was in a hurry and did not want to listen.  Not going back to him unless I absolutely have no choice.,Male
"My issues with my experience with Dr. O'Malley were that he acted as if he was in a rush throughout the examination; when actually performing the physical examination there was no warning whatsoever that he was going to proceed as he had JUST sat down in front of me and went right on in, and the same thing goes for when he inserted the speculum which of course was extremely alarming and made me tense up (making it even more uncomfortable than normal).  He should be more conscious of that stuff.",Male
"Dr Sonny O and his staff are highly trained professionals. Not only did I get amazing results from my procedure, but I was treated with care and respect. Dr O is a very skilled surgeon who is very good at his craft and his staff is very well trained. I had a great experience and I would do it again-I truly love my results and look and feel 10 years younger. Thank you so much Dr O and all of your amazing staff!",Male
"I love the natural results that Dr. O achieved with my neck lift. I had no bruising, very little swelling and almost no pain. It is wonderful to look in the mirror and not see all that loose skin that use to be there. The care after my procedure was excellent. I would definitely recommend Dr. O to people who are considering a cosmetic procedure.",Male
"In answer to your two questions -should you do it, and should you go to Dr. Sonny O. A resounding yes and yes! I was hesitant, to say the least, to having anything done to improve my appearance for various reasons - fear, doubts, growing old gracefully, etc. When I finally made the decision to move forward, I was thinking in terms of botox and fillers as my sister-in-law looks amazing from her treatments.  At my biannual visit to my dermatologist, I asked him about doing it and he steered me in ",Male
"It has been almost 5 years since my procedure and I am still loving the results! Very minimal discomfort. Dr. O is a wonderful, highly skilled surgeon who I would highly recommend.",Male
"Trusting your face to someone is a big decision. Thank goodness I chose Dr. O. The results are natural, the price was affordable and the staff was very supportive. Sandy did my IPL, she was very skilled at keeping any discomfort to a minimum. Highly recommend.",Male
RECENTLY had a necklift. I am 68 good health and pleased with results. BEST STAFF EVER. FUN TO PULL my hair up and wear v necks. JUST follow all directions and allow 2 weeks before you go out on the town. I golf so no golf for at least 6 weeks.,Male
Absolutely horrible. You could not pay me for this man to touch me. Very poor quality work. It would take a short book to list the reasons why I would not recommend this Doctor. Initial impressions of office and staff draw you into a nightmare that will haunt you the rest of your life. Please do your research before even scheduling a consult. Save your time and money and go to someone else.,Male
"Dr. O'Brien is intelligent, professional and always compassionate.  She never makes you feel silly or stupid for being concerned and will answer any question you have about your child.  I highly recommend Dr. O'Brien and wish more doctors were like her.",Female
"Dr. Danielle Obanion is one of the worst doctors. After having a leading doctor in MA for more than 20 years retire, I tried Obanion. She is dismissive of her patients symptoms. Every issue I brought up was ""menopausal"". As it turned out, I ended up this past April in emergency gallbladder surgery from symptoms I'd been complaining about for two years. She had even noted a spiked blood pressure at my last appointment, and said simply ""we should watch that"". I had never had elevated blood pressure prior to that appointment, and it is one of the key tipoffs to gallbladder combined with my other complaints of regular bloating, and sharp shooting pains (all indicators of gallstones). when I had a tick bite and needed to get antibiotics, she refused unless I came to her office, and when I agreed, she said she had no appointments for a week (by then it would have been too late to get on antibiotics), so I ended up in emergency care.  Avoid this doctor like the plague.",Female
I feel like he listens to my needs and is a great doctor for my son.... I love having a doctor whom treats his patients with care...,Male
Dr. O'Banion is awesome! My daughter has seen him off and on for a couple years now and he is so good with her and always makes sure to explain things in Layman's terms for the both of us when needed. I HIGHLY recommend him to anyone in the general vicinity looking for an outstanding pediatrician ,Male

They are professional 100 % caring insightful and information",Female
"My First Encounter With Leigh Ann O'Banion As A New Patient, Left Me With She Was Unprofessional By Yelling At One Of Her Assistants That, 'She Was The Doctor And Don't You Forget That'!!  Rude And Uncalled For In Front Of A New Patient.  Her Bedside Manners Lack Luster.  She Is Very Pushy. 'Power Trip'! Insisting I Needed Unnecessary Surgery After Having One Which Came Up Negative And Have Different Surgery One Week Later And Threatened Me If I Didn't She Would No Longer Treat Me!   SEEK OTHER!",Female
"Everything but the physician was great. She was rude, her bedside manner was unprofessional, and I left in tears. My first encounter with her lasted no more than 5 minutes. Please don't let your loved ones experience this",Female
Do not bother wasting your time. The man is either scared to give a children's aspirin. Or he just pushes whatever the pharmaceutical rep wants him to! He prescribed me several medications that have nothing to do with what I was there for. One of the prescriptions had a side effect that was identical to the problem I was there for!!!! Seemed to me like he was just there putting in time for a resume. I highly DON'T  recommend! !,Male

Dr. O'Bannon explains your issues so that you can understand and definitely makes you feel that he cares about you and your issues.

Years ago he also treated my Father, and spent time meeting with the family to explain my father's condition and things we could do to help him.  Again he was extremely caring, professional and helpful.

I have never been to another Doctor who is willing to spend the time with you and explain things so fully and in terms you can understand as Dr. O'Bannon does.",Male

Willing to say, ""I don't know"" and make a referral instead of BS-ing his way through.   But he eventually got upset enough that he no longer accepts Medicare - after a year of paying out-of-pocket, we went elsewhere.  But, if Tom would return to Medicare, we'd be back in a heartbeat!  Staff are great! ",Male

"Very smart, kind, took the time to explain things well and was thorough. ",Male
If were able to give zero stars I would. This office does not get back to their patients - It's been 20+ days and  haven't yet been contacted regarding a PFT despite numerous requests to be given a call back. A formal grievance has been put into Weill Cornell. I would recommend this Doctor.,Female

The day of surgery, Dr. O'Bert walked with the team as they rolled me to the OR and then again back to my recovery room easing my anxiety - it meant a lot that he took the extra time to make sure I was okay. At my follow-up appointments Dr. O'Bert answered all my questions and concerns. He is a patient focused physician! Highly Recommend!",Male
He explained the procedure well and I was very pleased with the results.  I have been dealing with sinus infections for over 50 years.   I can now eat a meal without blowing my nose.  My use of tissues has decreased by 90%.,Male
Dr O'Bert is very professional and spends the time with you to help you understand what is going on.  He is a very clear communicator.   He performed surgery on my nose to fix it (it had been broken for 12 years and healed broken) and did a good job of clearing things up so I can breathe again.,Male
I would highly recommend Dr. Obert.,Male
Wonderful doctor!!,Male
"Dr. O'Bert performed surgery on a deviated septum, ears, and sinuses. The whole experience was smooth and I was told what to expect. Recovery was just as I was told and I did not have any issues. Dr. O'Bert was communicative and nice and his nurse Rhonda was also very knowledgeable and kind. The office staff was also nice, which counts for a lot in my book. I also did not have to wait past my appointment time, which I very much appreciate. I would not hesitate to reach out to his office again. It's hard to find any doctor in which a surgery runs this smooth.",Male
"Dr. O'Bert and his entire staff did an excellent job from my first visit, through surgery and follow up.",Male
Dr. O'Bert listened carefully to what my current and past issues were. He was gentle with his examination and discussed what he found. He laid out options and discussed the pros and cons of each. He was warm and informative.,Male
"I ended up getting septoplasty. Dr.Obert and his team did a damn good job with my procedure. Wait times were very good, I got in as a new patient very quick. Surgery was well scheduled and was able to give my work a big heads up before the surgery. The staff is great all the nurses do their job great. Clean office wasn't dirty. Dr. Obert is very informative. Easy to talk to. And a very cool  doctor.",Male
Rob performed extensive surgery on my sinuses to perfection. All went well and I'm feeling the best I have in years. Nurse Shelly is very professional and friendly. A great team.,Male
"I would highly recommend Dr. O'Bert to anyone needing an ENT physician. I found scheduling appointments to be simple and he was always punctual.  Dr. O’Bert explained everything my condition thoroughly &amp; in terms that were easily understandable.  He provided all options available to treat my chronic sinus problems and, once surgery was selected, he reviewed the details again with me and my girlfriend to set everyone’s expectations about the surgery and recovery process. 
Not only was Dr. O’Bert incredibly accommodating and helpful but his office staff was top notch.  When my insurance was slow to approve the procedures, Shelly and the other staff worked directly with them to resolve the issues to the extent possible.  Ultimately, even after the team’s involvement, my insurance required Dr. O’Bert to speak with one of their representatives to resolve their concerns (something that he did at 6:30 pm the night prior to the surgery).  
Honestly, I could not recommend Dr. O’Bert and his sta",Male
I have had two surgeries with Dr. O'Bert for my thyroid.  He and his staff have all been wonderful and have worked hard to get to the bottom of my issues and resolve them quickly.

"Dr. Rob O'bert MD was absolutely fantastic. He was very thorough, kind and understanding. He explained my options and got a treatment plan organized which effectively treated my chronic sinus problems I've had for many years. I would very highly recommend him to anyone needing an excellent ENT. Appointments ran on-time and the staff was superb and very caring. I also work in the medical field so my expectations are even higher. Dr. O'bert was excellent in every aspect of my care plan. He came very highly recommended from a physician I work with. I never thought I could be well again and it is very comforting to feel so much better again after years of misery and two prior sinus surgeries with a different ENT. Thank you so much Dr. O'bert. If I could rate you higher, I would. Do not hesitate to entrust him and his staff to care for you.",Male
"Terrible experience! Ordered several tests over several months, not able to offer any medical input!

More of an 'NT than a ENT, after ordering a very expensive battery of test very expensive tests, CT, MRI, and Audiology Testing over the span of months, all he's able to say is he recommends a otologist!? I thought we were seeing an EAR nose and throat doctor, but It seems like we were just made to pay for enough test to satisfy his ego that he would be able to diagnose a condition that obviously seems beyond his capability.
  
Completely disappointed, i guess he may be fine if you need Amoxicillin for an ear ache, but if you need real medial input look elsewhere!",Male
"I had been going to a different doctor in the same immediate area who was entirely unresponsive. I'd been having trouble breathing through my nose and had frequent nosebleeds and nasal infections. After about a years worth of trips to that doctor I switched to Dr. O'bert. 

The first visit he checked on the problem and almost immediately said ""You have a deviated septum."" I would have thought the other doctor would have been able to diagnose that as well.

Dr. O'bert did the septoplasty as well as revising a large scar on my neck that was improperly completed by the other doctor. I no longer get infections on that scar, nor do I have to look for volunteers to pull hairs out of any of the glaring irregularities that were left prior to O'berts revision.",Male
"Excellent bedside manner; Dr. O’Bert explains thoroughly, and listens to my questions and concerns.  His staff provides very thorough follow-up, and it has been a pleasure communicating with them.",Male
"I had a deviated septum operation performed on July 17th 2019 by Dr O'Bert. He was very professional, confident, and thorough. He has a good bed side manner and the most important thing is I can now breathe fully without drugs or holding my nose open to get air. I would definitely recommend him.",Male

I saw D. O'Boyle for workman's comp.  He didn't listen to me very much.  On my final visit he said he didn't know why I was in so much pain from my knee and to just start walking and.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.,Male
"I had horrible experiences with Dr. O'Boyle. I have seen him since last October with a Workers Comp injury. He always acted like I was faking, took very little time to find the problem. Ordered tests and then said he didn't see anything on them. But both times the radiologists who looked at them both said there was something there. He was my second opinion and because of that WC now wants to settle even though I'm not fixed. I wouldn't take my dog to Dr. O'Boyle! ",Male

Dr. O’Boynick went through a series of tests, had me try PT and even a shot in my spine but it was evident I was going to need surgery. His explanation of everything he would do during surgery was concise as well as what to expect afterward.

After 2 years of trying other methods of treatment, Dr. O'Boynick gave me back my life.  I had immediate relief from my back &amp; leg pain.  My symptoms are gone,  I feel 25 years younger.  If it wasn't for social distancing, etc, my wife would have hugged him &amp; thanked him profusely.

He operated. Afterwards I could not walk.  . I could not sit for long. I couldn’t imagine going home.  I was walking with a walker for two weeks. He extended my leave. Fast forward to now. Almost 3 months later, I am walking with a cane. I can’t bend over. I am still in pain. I saw him. Like most of his reviews. He is cold. In and out in mins. He questioned my pain and progress and told me I was ready to go to physical therapy twice a week. Here’s the kicker. He told my insurance I was cleared to work. I called the office and was told everyone is cleared for work after 3 months. He couldn’t tell me to my face that he is releasing me.  Inside he files the paper work I find out from my work that I should be reporting back. Why? Because his work and reputation are more important than being honest.",Male

After 4 months of terrible back pain and therapy 2 to 3 times a week, I realized my orthotics were incorrect.

He takes the time to explain things thoroughly and answer all of your questions, no matter how extensive they might be.  He saved my running career with his custom orthotics.",Male
"Stay away from this doctor. He told me all about his personal life and didn’t really care to listen to me about my foot pain. He talked for 40 minutes all about himself and his medical knowledge. His foot masseuses are rude and brutal. I went for months, and when I questioned why I didn't get better, he told me to see someone else. I've been to see someone else one time with one treatment for my feet, and they are already feeling better. Only good thing are the 2 women in the front office.",Male

"Dr. O'Brien listened to me nearly 3 years ago when I insisted that the blemish on my nipple should be investigated even though I had a clear mammogram two months prior. She ordered a sonogram, which was inconclusive. I was still insistent so she ordered an MRI, which found a lesion that proved to be invasive ductal carcinoma. Dr. O'Brien respects and empowers her patients and I feel very lucky she has been part of my healthcare team. She performed the nipple-sparing mastectomy with hidden scar technique and together with the reconstructive surgeons have given me a nearly flawless new breast to match my healthy breast.",Female
"I thank God and my PC everyday for Dr O'Brien. Finding out you have cancer is bad enough, but being directed to an excellent top of the line surgeon was like a true miracle. I hope that I never have to refer anyone to her, but would in a heartbeat. She is one of the 'good ones'...",Female

"Dr. O'Brien
There is not enough space in this little box to express my gratitude for her warm, compassionate way of treating me. Since my very first visit with her, I have trusted her. I was scared out of my mind when I found out I had breast cancer. Terrified. She was the first doctor I saw. She went through her findings step by step with me, telling me what they found and how it would be treated.  My husband is hard of hearing and because of COVID could not come to my appointment with me. She let me record my visit on my phone so that he would  know what I knew.  I just saw her last week for my 3 month follow up after surgery.  We talked about small things this time but she still showed the warm compassionate ways of dealing with me and my concerns. I would recommend her over and over.  Thanks Dr. O'Brien for making this dreadful disease easier to deal with.  Teresa Manuel",Female
"Dr O'Brien is the best surgeon you can have! After my lumpectomy, I had some swelling and  she went out of her way after office hours to check on me. She wanted to assess the swelling right away and asked me to send her pictures on her personal number. Hands down the best doctor to have on your care team. She is extremely patient and explains everything in detail. I never once felt rushed. Appointments are quick with no wait times. She has such a calm demeanor and I truly felt I could trust and depend on her and her team. They do call backs right away and her entire team is quite prompt and professional.",Female
"Dr. O'Brien has been great, From pre mastectomy right through to one year anniversary. She has always taken the time to answer our questions, talk over treatment alternatives and help me with my decisions.",Female
Dr. O’Brien is a very skilled surgeon!    She has a terrific bedside manner and is eager to answer Any question or concern.,Female
"Have you ever wondered what to do once you have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer?  So many things go though your mind and you want to make sure you have picked the right surgeon. I was diagnosed in February of 2018  and was sent to see Dr. O'Brien.  I am so glad I was referred to her, because I have never felt so comfortable and knew once we met, she was going to take excellent care of me.  This was a drastic change in my life, and I needed someone who was there.  SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE. THANK U",Female
"I had 1 appointment with Dr. O'Brien, and then 2 months later received a collections past due notice. Krystal said they sent me 2 bills, and when I stated that I never received 1, she sent me a copy of a ledger statement. After I received that, I asked for an actual copy of the bills. She said she would call me back the next day about sending them to me, but I never heard back and that was weeks ago, so it appears those bills never existed. The office is too rude and disorganized for me.",Female
"We love Dr. O'Brien - she sees both of my kids and was there since birth of my son. Both of them love her! She is very relatable and knows her stuff, she is up to date on so much. She isn't overly pushy either, Dr. O'Brien truly wants what's best for your child but doesn't offer more than what is necessary and will work with your comfort level. I breastfeed and have an intact son- she welcomes both! I highly recommend her :) ",Female
"I have recommended Dr. O'Brien to friends and family and I will continue to recommend her. My wife recently gave birth to our first child, so of course we had many questions and concerns. Dr. O'Brien has been patient and understanding of our new parent neuroses. We are always treated with respect and care and couldn't be more pleased or more confident in our choice of pediatricians. She is educated, intelligent, and kind, and doesn't even mind when our baby pees all over the examining table ;)",Female
"I've worked with her throughout my breast cancer process.  She interacts with both my husband and me, listening and answering questions.   Throughout this time, there have been periods of routine (as throughout my chemo) and not so routine as r.t. dyspnea on exertion/fatigue which was present prior to cancer diagnosis with no  diagnosis determined by either cardiology or pulmonology.  She makes contact, as needed, with my other MDs, looking at all aspects (not just cancer).",Female
"Had a spinal tap, and ct venography that should have made everything very apparent to this doctor. I was dismissed in retaliation, because I had contacted the hospital advocates after my spinal tap showed evidence of infection and received no word from the doctor for two weeks. Unbelievable to say the least. Will never suggest using this neurologist.",Female
"I saw Dr. O'Brien for treatment of my Migraines. I tried to correspond with her afterwards regarding treatment options and concerns of mine, and she failed to communicate back with me after my several attempts of reaching her over the course of three weeks. I understand that physicians are busy but to just not return calls or messages through the Uchealth app is poor quality of care. I will be pursuing treatment elsewhere.",Female
"Dr. O'Brien is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and the most thorough provider I have experienced. I felt she ordered appropriate testing for my condition. She has patiently adjusted my medication treatment to give me the best outcomes. I highly recommend her as a Neurologist. ",Female
"This doctor his highly unethical, continual changes treatment plans, is no clear on plan of treatment, lies. Has not empathy towards your situation. She acts like she may but then when confronted, she will lie and throw you under the bus. If you are being treated for migraine, she will promise to keep you on a pain control regimen and then just remove it all. Stay clear away! ",Female
"The experience with Dr O'Brian was second to none.  The time, expertise and simple thoughtfulness given to my son during his challenging surgery and follow up was beyond anything we could have hoped for. She provided her time and professional excellence in a way that gave us not only comfort but information in every aspect of our issues and concerns. No stone was left unturned.

"I saw Dr. O'Brien at St. Clare's ER this month. She was a great listener and took extra time to keep my wife updated about the decisions she was making, which was nice because visitors weren't allowed due to pandemic rules. I felt very comfortable in her care.",Female
"Dr O'brien came in to the patient room without having read the charts for my mother. She asked a question to me and in the middle of my answer she stopped me due to her lack of comprehension of my answer She then questioned degree of care she was receiving at home. 
   They had to draw blood twice because the original files of blood drawn were not labeled.  Then a third time blood was drawn, seriously?
   My mother was at this same hospital the night before the night before and released????????.",Female

cares about her patients. She has been my psychiatrist for over 13 years. I cannot imagine ever having to find another doctor. She's accessible and understanding. She is one of the wisest people I've ever met",Female
The office staff are extremely unhelpful and their billing practices are questionable. I have been a patient for a couple of years and the level of care I received during that time has diminished greatly. I have left 4 messages with no call back. I was given the wrong written prescription in December and I am still trying to get it resolved 7 weeks later. I don’t feel like I’m cared about or respected as a patient. I would not recommend this practice.,Female
"This review is mostly about Dr. O’Brien’s staff. The receptionists are not helpful and passive aggressive. Why? It is so disconcerting. My daughter needed a refill who is out of state in college and they negated our concerns when she had run out of her meds. She was suffering from withdrawals! My god, they were rude and lacked complete empathy. She is a Freshman away from home for the first time and suffering and they were heartless. Whoa. We have no choice but to change psychiatrists. Be aware.",Female

"My husband was hospitalized for an operation, got C Diff in the hospital/nursing home and was referred to Dr. O'Brian. My husband did not eat and had lost a great deal of weight. (I am a nurse) . Not eating he was unable to heal well from his operation. His issues were not handled in the hospital, and not well handled afterward. When the condition recurred after antibiotics, it was almost impossible to arrange to see anyone in the practice. On hold for 15 minutes.",Male
"Competent, caring. Takes time to address questions, concerns and procedures to be done, including reasons for the procedure to be done.",Male
"Upon receiving a POSITIVE test result in a Colo-Guard test, I was referred to Dr. O'Brien by my internal medicine physician. I was self medicating, over ten years, for GERD and arthritis pain, using Aleve and Zantac. A stomach ulcer was found during a endoscopy. After his treatment and advice GERD has disappeared. I can now sleep good at night and use Tylenol as needed for arthritis. Dr. O'Brien is very caring and knowledgeable.

"I was very anxious about hemerroidectomy recovery but it was easier than I feared.  I attribute this completely to having Dr. O'Brien as my surgeon.  He's the best at what he does, period.  I'm certain that no one in the Portland area could have done this surgery as well as he did.  Prior to the surgery, he was very upfront with me about what to expect and how to prepare (diet, fiber, rest, etc).  He worked with me to explore different pain relief medicines (check out gabapentin).  Five stars!!!",Male
A very capable Surgeon. He is very cautious and this is what you want when you put your surgery into someone's hands. I highly recommend him for his professionalism and great skill in this line of work. He is highly regarded by his peers as well. We are very grateful to this doctor.,Male
"I previously went to Dr. O'Brien for an extreme eye irritation.  Turned out it was a small piece of metal.  He was very professional and very thorough in the exam.  He immediately extracted the metal and provided the right medications for quick recovery.  I liked him so much I decide to see him about performing a lasik touchup (I had one 20 years ago elsewhere).  After an extensive exam, he advised me that it was possible for him to perform, however, not recommended due to possible complications with my reading vision.  His integrity, along with his knowledge and professionalism completely won me over.  I will go to no other eye doctor from this point forward.",Male

"I went to Dr O’Brien as a 21 yr old w spinal pain that radiates down my legs. The referring dr told me I would likely get an X-ray &amp;/or ultrasound. Nope. He offered to write me a script for muscle relaxers and spinal injections before examining me&amp; seemed incredulous when I told him I wanted an X-ray. I also told him that I have sprained the same ankle several times within the last year and have always struggled with motor control. He told me it would cost “billions” if “everyone with back aches” got scans.He felt some lipomas in my back &amp;said that it wasn’t possible they contributed to any pain. However, since he didn’t think the lipomas contributed to the pain it made no sense he wouldn’t do an X-ray! I told him id done research and while lipomas are usually fine, they’re an issue when they hurt and compress nerves... esp along the spine. Seems it should go without saying... he said it wasn’t his expertise and refused to refer me to a specialist. He was very unthorough&amp; condescending",Male
I have been blessed with excellent care from Dr. O’Brien. I have always appreciated the fact that he helped me choose options that did not require surgery. I have found him to be kind and compassionate always seeking the best for his patients.,Male

If you want expert professional advice and treatment, I would highly recommend Dr. O'Brien. ",Male
"I am writing this because I want others to know what kind of doctor he is. If you don't agree with him he will request to not see you again. That is what he has done to me. What kind of doctor would do that to a patient with spine issues. He also doesn't write his reports in a manner to help you with being out of work. DON'T GO TO HIM YOU WILL BE  SORRY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is a unprofessional so called doctor, out for your money only. ",Male
"My experience with Dr. O'Brien went very well today.  He was professional, knowledgeable, friendly and caring.

"I have seen Dr. O'Brien multiple times over the last 7 years and was always very happy with the outcome of his treatment or recommendations.  Seven years ago I saw him for the first time for a rotator cuff tear after several months of PT.  He did the surgery to repair it and my shoulder has never been better.  He successfully treated me for tennis elbow and other tennis related injuries and I've always been extremely happy with the results.

"Dr Obrien has poor bedside manner at best - he is a poor communicator in what could and would happen after a surgery, He may do surgeries every week, but I have never had surgery  - He is also very quick to recommend surgery without other options
After Surgery, not everyone is the same - I was in terrible pain and could not get a stronger pain medication from his PA or him. ",Male

"I have seen a number of doctors over 25 years for a cough that started as a minor nuisance but had progressed to where it became quite violent and where I would almost pass out at times. Most doctors thought it was allergies, acid reflux or they just didn't know. I gave it another try a few years ago and went to see Dr. O'Brien. While I thought the prognosis was headed to the same results as the past, Dr. O'Brien suspected it could be a rare neurological condition that he had learned of and one that was difficult to diagnose. Fortunately, there was a doctor in Boston who was one of the few researchers for this condition. I went to see him, was treated, and saw immediate results. Several years later, I write this review because today I biked 10 miles in 90 degree heat and said to myself during the ride that this would never have happened had Dr. O'Brien not come up with this diagnosis. I thank Dr. O'Brien for figuring it out for me and thinking outside of the box!",Male

My mom is doing great we could not have had a better doctor or team.  Very caring pofessional and is a top doctor that I highly recommend.  Thank you,Male
DR  O'BRIEN AND HIS GROUP ARE GREAT. THEY HAVE HELPED ME SO MUCH.  WHEN I WAS FIRST SEEN THEY OPENED THIER OFFICE EARLY TO SEE ME WHEN I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN.  I HAD A LARGE HERNIATION IN MY NECK PRESSING ON MY SPINAL CORD.  THIS WAS  CAUSING SEVERE PAIN IN MY RIGHT ARM WHICH NEEDED SURGERY RIGHT AWAY.  HIS GROUP MADE ALL THE CALLS TO HOSPITAL AND INSURANCE AND JUST GAVE ME A TIME TO GO TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY. I CONTINUE TO DO WELL AND HAVE RETURNED TO WORK.  I RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYBODY.,Male
"I found Dr. O'Brien and his staff to be very compassionate and easy to talk to.  I was seen by a large orthopedic group and was told I needed surgery.  After reviewing my films and taking the time to actually listen to me, Dr. O'Brien recommended against surgery and treated me conservatively.  So far, so good.  So glad to have found a doctor with integrity.",Male
"Horrible! What he did to my mom was unspeakable! 2 surgeries later, and she is worse now! And went to a completely different dr, and has to get another surgery! The dr told her he never seen this kind of scar my moms house in 30 years! I don't know what dr. Obrien did???? Please beware!!! And go to someone else!",Male
After a 20 hour flight I was experiencing  terrible back pain. I was referred to Dr. Obrien's office buy urgent care. The office staff managed to arrange for an immediate MRI. In fact one of the staff doctors even drove me to the MRI facility in that I had no vehicle. After initial evaluation It was determined that I had needed  immediate intervention at an associated surgical facility. I can highly recommend Dr. O'Brien and his most competent staff for their professionalism and caring attitude.,Male
"After over a year of seeing several different doctors at both Rothman &amp; South Jersey Sport Medicine, many MRI,s and epidural shots that provided no relief.  A friend recommended  Dr.Evan O'Brien, I am so happy that I made that appointment after a few visits we had a plan I needed a disc replacement surgery L5 S1. Dr O,Brien performed the surgery and I finally had relief. If you are like me and surgery is the last thing you want but you need go see Dr O,Brien he is a doctor you can trust..",Male
"Dr. O'Brien performed two surgeries on my spine in 2015.  In September, I had a 5 level laminectomy on my lower spine. Great work! He alleviated my back pain and sciatic nerve pain completely. Again in December I had numbness n my fingers on both hands due to severe compression of my spinal cord in C 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5.  A fusion was performed and the problem solved. Numbness is gone and feeling restored.  Great surgeon and wonderful staff.  I wholeheartedly would recommend Dr. O'Brien.",Male
"Doctor O'Brien and his entire staff are the friendliest, most thorough and accommodating group of healthcare individuals I have ever had the pleasure of being treated by. The doctor, his Physician Assistants, Medical Coordinator and Office Manager all spend as much time as is needed to fully educate the patient on his or her specific condition. Patients are then presented with options for treatment beginning with the least invasive to more involved if that is what is needed to provide relief.",Male
Dr. O'Brien never rushes he takes the time he feels necessary to deal with his patients and is very thorough. He has cared for me for the last 14 years so my confidence in him is absolute.,Male
I have been seeing Dr O'Brian for almost 20 yrs and would not think of seeing anyone else. The best Dr I have ever had. He takes his time listens to what you  have to say and explains things so you understand. If he is still taking patients consider yourself lucky.,Male
"Amazing surgeon, doctor and a very kind man who cares for people! Dr O'Brien did my carpal tunnel release surgery 2 weeks ago! I wish I didn't wait that long, but maybe wouldn't be as lucky with a great surgeon! Thank you!!!",Male
"She was by far the best doctor I’ve had. She spent lots of time listening and I felt totally cared for. I would recommend her to anyone. She helped me through a dark time and made sure I was on the right medications. I think she’s terrific. Also, I first went to her when I lived in Massachusetts. I’ve since moved to Nashua, NH and continue to have her as my primary care physician.",Female
"looking for a doctor who your not sure how they got thier leicense, look no furuthur o'breins your doctor. long story short, horrible bedside manner, dosent really listento your concerns. its almost like while you talk she is thinking of what to say. anything a simple as refilling a prescription is a hassle ",Female
"HORRIBLE bedside manner, doesn't listen to patients' concerns, very old school doctor. She will just prescribe medicine without trying to help you get to a root cause or will simply turn you away if she thinks you're fine and doesn't take any requests for further testing. One time I had a simple question for her and she made me make an appointment with her to ask it - question was answered in 2 minutes and it was the least helpful response and then I got billed for the appointment.. DO NOT RECOM",Female
"Dr. O'Brien treated me with very little respect. Based on the significant number of poor professional reviews she has received online, I think that she might want to reconsider her approach to her patients or even her choice of profession. It's clear that she does not enjoy patient interaction which is the most fundamental role primary care physicians perform. I really can't imagine that patients would trust Dr. O'Brien enough to reveal the type of information that might one day save their lives",Female
"I have been looking for a primary care doctor who would take the time to understand my approach to my health.  Based on her video, I selected Dr. O'Brien. I prefer a holistic approach and hoped to be able to discuss this with her. Instead I felt judged, and dismissed. ",Female
Gina is a terrific doctor that takes the time to fully understand each situation and child.  She is very caring and loving.  Both our children adore her.  I would recommend her to anyone in need of a Dr.,Female
As always Grace has been there to help when ever I have had any health problems she listens to what I have to say has and  helped keep me in good shape,Female
"Dr. O’Brien and staff are fast and efficient, also very friendly. Very happy with how I was treated.",Female
I’ve been with Dr O’Brien for 20+ years and always appreciate her caring manner . She runs behind on time occasionally but I don’t mind waiting if I get to see her,Female
I like Dr. Grace O'Brien. She is very professional and knowledgeable. I feel comfortable ( I believe it's very important.)  I recommend her. She is very busy though!,Female
"She is considerate, LISTENS, and fixes everything wrong with you!!",Female
Thorough and knowledgeable about almost everything and willing to refer you if if you need a specialty. Easy to talk to and takes time with you to hear your concerns or answer your questions. I highly recommend Dr. O'Brien.,Female
Great doctor and staff,Female
"Dr. O'Brien is always so kind and caring. I know how busy she is, but I never feel rushed at my visits. I would go several miles to see her.",Female
I liked that Dr. O'Brien spent time with me and asked lots of questions and explained things I didn't understand.  Now to wait for the results of my lab work to try and find out what's wrong with me.,Female
She listens and cares about your issues. Great doctor. Very knowledgeable regarding meds,Female
"She’s so knowledgeable, precise .
She is a great doctor

I gave 5 stars for every area.
Not sure if it took them all. Hard to tell",Female
Dr. O'Brien is an excellent Primary Care doctor!  She is very kind and caring. Her 30 + years of experience shows in the knowledge and wisdom she displays. I am very blessed to have Dr. O'Brien for my PC doctor.,Female
Dr. Grace takes the time to explain her diagnosis.,Female
"Made an appt w/Dr. O'Brien to go over latest fasting blood work as liver functions have been elevated. 

She was very patient and responsive to my request to explain what each elevated lab meant.  She told me what I needed to do and complimented me on my cholesterol score, which has improved with her putting me on medication. 

I think she is an outstanding doctor and genuinely cares about me.

Thank you.",Female
I’ve been seeing Dr Grace for pretty much her whole career and she’s never let me down. She takes the time to really listen and is very compassionate and I always leave her office feeling better than when I arrived. ,Female
Staff prompt &amp; helpful.  Doctor O’Brien writes notes for me to take with me detailing my visit &amp; how to use &amp; take the prescriptions I have received.  These notes are such a helpful reminder.  Office is clean &amp; comfortable.,Female
She is one my favorite people,Female
"Grace is one of the most compassionate and caring medical providers I have ever known. I have known Grace since she was a resident. She showed her compassion for her patients and enthusiasm to learn back then. 
I then had the opportunity to have her accept me as a student for my clinical years as a physician assistant in my last year of my training. 
After my 20 years of practice, Dr. O’Brien continues to be at the very top of my list of the most compassionate, knowledgeable and trustworthy physicians I know of. She has the best referral base and Grace is one of the few who still practices the “Art” of medicine which is currently hard to find.",Female
"Dr. O’Brien is always so cheerful, makes you feel at ease. She give a thorough examination. Dr. O’Brien always has a listening ear.  GREAT DOCTOR.  ",Female
Today I had my yearly physical and Dr. Grace O’Brien explained everything to me on how I was doing. I could not ask for a better Doctor than Grace O’Brien. She is the best and so is her staff. I would recommend Doctor O”Brien to anyone. But she has enough patients at this time that keeps her extremely busy. ,Female
"She was exactly 1 hour late and we were the first appt of the day. No apology. Just a ""oh I heard you weren't happy"" remark. 
Didnt tell us anything we didnt already know, prescribed some meds and she was done. Won't schedule my son with her again.",Female
Her fellow spent 45 minutes taking a history.  All of that information was sent weeks ahead of the visit.  The fellow questioned current medications  as if we prescribed them.  The fellow told us we were wrong over and over.  It was a very negative experience. And Dr. O'Brien spent all of 15 minutes with us.,Female
Initial visit:Took a good history and listened well.  Recommended appropriate followup and alleviated my concerns.,Male
Excellent! Dr. O'Brien was one of the kindest and sweetest doctors I have ever seen. He took the time to explain illness and treatment with me.,Male
"Excellent. Anwers all questions  , explains dx. adequately and goes the extra mile in providing documentation.. ",Male
"I have seen some negative reviews of Dr. O’Brien and I wanted to add my perspective to provide some fairness and balance. First, we need to recognize that someone who has a negative experience is far more likely to comment than those that are satisfied with their visit. That said, I have had some bad experiences with other sleep doctors. However, I have been seeing Dr. O’Brien for several years and every visit has been positive. He is excellent at explaining things, prompt, professional and personable. All his staff that I have interacted with have been the same.",Male
"One of the worst specialists I've seen. I switched to a new sleep doc &amp; when he looked at my chart, he said Dr. O's data and conclusions don't match up AT ALL, rendering my MSLT faulty and requiring a repeat of this 2 day stressful sleep study. I wish I'd never gone to him in the first place. What a waste of my time and money! Not only is he incompetent, he's rude, &amp; he didn't even bother to look at my chart before appts so he never remembered why I was there or what I needed or what I'd tried.",Male
"One of the WORST doctors I've ever seen. Started literally every appointment saying ""I'm going to change your LIFE today with Provigil,"" a medication I REPEATEDLY told him didn't work for me. He put me on Nuvigil, which gave me side effects. I called the office &amp; he told me to discontinue it. Next appt, he said he was gonna change my life with Provigil. Reminded him it didn't work. He tried to write me a script to try Nuvigil, which HE had just taken me off. Try reading my chart first next time!",Male
"13 minutes late, and the receptionist dressed in a polka dot shirt covered with a pajama top and a snowman hat told me I had to reschedule and I couldn't be seen for another 2 months. Hope nothing is actually wrong!!",Male
"The doctor refers to himself in the third person all the time. Pressures you into using equipment that you would rather not have and said that I would not be able to have a procedure without a CPAP, because it would be malpractice. One other thing he said is there is not a weight problem in the country and people are overweight, because they do not get enough sleep.",Male
"I had an appointment with Dr. Patel in September 2020. Since Covid was pretty rampant,  masks were mandatory.  He walked into the room and with his back to me, he starts talking. Didn't introduce himself.  I asked if he was Dr. Patel and I got this look. Sorry, but if you are going to be 2"" from my masked face, please have the courtesy to introduce yourself.  He wasn't thrilled when I asked how many procedures he's done and how long in practice.  Didn't really answer my questions, but was very anxious for me to book a surgical appointment.  He said his procedures were in a medical spa environment.  A 1 star rating for him is generous.

I called for a referral for doctors at UCSD at the Shiley Institute. No comparison to the doctors at Shiley. The care and quality at UCSD and Shiley is excellent. My surgeon is one of the finest in California.",Male
I am an optometrist. I just examined one of Dr Patel’s post cataract surgery patients. Worst outcome I’ve seen in 30 years. Terrible!,Male
"I was quite pleased with the cataract surgery and related care I received from Dr. Patel. He is also quite friendly, punctual, and professional.",Male
He did my eye surgery in both of my eyes.  He is an amazing and very caring doctor.  He will explain any questions on anything you ask regarding your eyesight.  Great customer service and the nurses are really caring and sweet.  I will recommend him to everyone I know.  ????I am greatful that I am under his care.,Male
He performed surgery on both eyes. They surgery and recovery both went well. Amazing doctor and great customer service at his office.,Male
"I have been a patient at this location for several years and I always receive great service.  Both Dr. Patel and the staff are knowledgeable and efficient.  They are also patient, timely, and kind with everyone that I see coming in during my appointments.",Male
I only wish I lived closer to the office.,Female
Dr. Jasmine Paadam has poor medical knowledge and horrible bedside manner. She examines her patient's without their consent and commits assault and battery. She does not know what are the most important issues for her patients. Stay away from Dr. Paadam and her practice. She is a criminal as is her supervisor. ,Female
Dr.Pappe is the best of the best. She saved my life more than once. She explains things thought. Answers your questions straight up honestly. Our family is so grateful to get and her staff. They are wonderful. I would recommend her to Anyone 100 percent. Bless you wherever you are Doc.,Female
"I thought pickup trucks and Heart Surgery were a ""guy thing""....Boy Howdy was I wrong!  Just about the time that I needed the best Cardiac Surgeon in the world, in walks a 115-pound Angel and takes control of my life.  Never in my life have I been so blessed as I was that day.  No BS with this cowgirl.   Compassion, Care, Honesty and the Hands of God are all you get.  Oh, and you get a hand-picked Team of medical professionals that work together like Navy SEAL's.  Thanks Doc.",Female
"1000 miles from home and needing bypass surgery, to find a Doctor with the talent and personality of Dr. Paape was a true blessing. Great care to me and quality information to my family will always be in my memory. She is the best.",Female
"Dr. Parr was my family doctor for several years in Gilbert,Arizona. I felt she was in excellent doctor. I would highly recommend her.",Female
Dr Paar is compassionate and has great bedside manner. I love having her as my PCP. Her group also gets you in quickly when needed. ,Female
This Dr. is great. She has a lot of knowledge about many illnesses. She is very thorough and has great bedside manners.,Female
I love Dr. Parr and her assistant Melissa.  They both are very caring and knowledgeable.  My association with them has been wonderful! I have recommended several times.,Female
"My first appointment was a good experience. She was friendly, thorough, professional and down to earth. Upon completing her exam she ordered all the necessary tests that any competent doctor would order for a general physical exam. In 2018 however, going to her for an upper GI issue, she certainly had changed! No greeting me upon entering the exam room and her eyes spent more time on her laptop then me, the patient. Her exam was as cold as her attitude. Goodbye Dr., I need a Dr who cares for me.",Female
"I have been going to Dr. Paar since 2008 when she was in Gilbert. I followed her when she moved to Chandler, and again to Phoenix. She is an excellent Dr. She is highly intelligent and I trust her completely.  She has been correct in all her diagnoses. She is very professional, but personable as well.",Female
"One of those Doctors that will tell you what you should do without really listening. In her mind, she is the ""Doctor"" and you are the ""patient"" and you need to adhere to what she tells you without questioning.  If you don't, you will spend the visit politely but tensley arguing. 

Not a good fit for a person that sees the Doctor/patient relationship as peer to peer. ",Female
"I was impressed.  As a former hospital administrator, I've observed a variety of physicians. She's exceptional.  Thorough exam, excellent listening skills. Great written instructions. But the most unusual thing? She called on a Sunday night to see how I was doing with my nasty respiratory infection.  This goes above  and beyond in my opinion.  This entire practice (PV Family Medicine) is rock solid.   Love the excellent nurse practitioner, Lindsey Teel, RN, also.  ",Female
"Dr. Past was very thorough and very personable.  She talked to me and asked many intelligent questions.  She found out, thru specific tests, what my problem was.  I trust her very much.",Female
"I had almost given up on being a patient at Paradise Valley Family Medicine, but when my old doc left and I had an appointment w/ Dr. Paar, it renewed my faith. Dr. Paar is professional, caring, and empathic. I have had doctors in the past that treat you like cattle - in and out, little detail or concern for your maladies. Fortunately for both Dr. Paar and my own self care, I have gotten myself to an excellent place with my physical and mental health.
",Female
My case was somewhat complicated by Dr. Paar was patient and thorough in diagnosing the true cause.  I appreciated how she called that evening to see how I was doing.,Female
"All my appointments with Dr. Paar have been both professional, and relaxing. Dr. Paar has made me feel comfortable, and at rest when having seen her for my medical needs. She is very well informed, and when needed has kept me up to date with my physicals, and medical needs. Dr. Paar has a very relaxed demeanor, yet shows professionalism when addressing my medical questions. I would highly recommend Dr. Paar as a physician.",Female
Dr. Paar was wonderful in diagnosing my recent pneumonia that was misdiagnosed at a urgent care. She took her time and was very thorough with my care and follow up care. I've never had a Dr. or doctors office have such a human touch before. I fully trust Dr. Paar with my care and would recommend her to anyone I know. Thank you so much Dr. Paar!,Female
Dr. Paarlberg became my Childrens' physician after Dr. Cooney retired. I was devastated he had retired and very worried as to whether I would like the new physician. Dr. Paarlberg has exceeded my expectations and had been a genuinely kind and trustworthy physician. I couldn't have picked a better physician for my kids. I would highly recommend him to anyone. I can't speak highly enough and greatly appreciate his care for my children and respect to me as a parent. ,Male
"Dr. Paarlberg has been my doctor for more than three years now. He has been fantastic! Office staff is not very welcoming when making an appointment, but Dr. Paarlberg is all you can ask for in a doctor!",Male
"Excellent. He replaced my MD that had retired and I was highly skeptical. He has proven himself many times over. He is patient, knowledgeable and kind. ",Male
"Thank you Kennesaw Gynecology for taking women's health to the next level.  Not only do they offer services to make us look younger and feel better, such as dysport, laser hair removal and the O shot, but now they offer UltraSlim.  I just could not motivate myself to lose weight so I thought I would give this a chance.  The results were amazing.  After my first treatment, I lost 5 inches and 4 pounds.  I could not believe that could possibly happen in one very relaxing hour.  I'm more determined",Female
Not the greatest visit.  Receptionist is not capable of smiling.  The tech opened a bandage before pricking my finger.  She stuck the entire bandage on her arm and then proceeded to place it over my wound.  Very unsterile.  The doctor would not discuss all of my concerns...had to be a separate appointment as she this was my annual health visit and it would mess up insurance if she did anything else.  I have NEVER had an issue like that with other physicians.  I'm not going back...just felt icky!,Female
"Dr. Paas is one of my all time favorite doctors.  She listens, takes time, and is concerned for her patients.  I followed her from her last practice to this one.",Female
"I am a healthy healthcare worker who thought I was seeing a MD and staff whom was more educated on service and coverage. I would NOT recommend ever going back to this MD bc she &amp; her staff ( nurse &amp; Lab Corp ) employee she has working for her in back mislead me to believe with a"" wellness gyn check up"" that basic blood work was covered. I even WROTE on new pt. forms "" and "" DISCUSSED "" with all of them , nothing unless it was covered. A $450.00 bill later with no help from her or her office.",Female
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! AMAZING is an understatement! I have never felt more comfortable as I have with the staff at Kennesaw Gynecology. They are all extremely personable, knowledgeable, and care deeply for all of their patients. I recently visited the office for an O-Shot procedure and I couldn’t be more pleased with my experience!  My results from the O-SHOT were immediate!! I am extremely please with my results!! My sexual dysfunction improved immediately as well as my bladder issues!  If you ar",Female
I am so glad that Dr. Paas was accepting new patient's bc I have found my GYN. I have never felt at ease getting my annual but today I'm totally at ease!! Thank you to you and your staff for being great!!!! ,Female
"At end of my pregnancy (3), have lots of pain, went in and the doctor told me ""pregnancy hurts"" and as I was leaving the office he came after me after I overheard his nurse telling him I had an infection. That took me to the hospital 3 times, while they changed my medication over the phone! Lead to pre term labor. A week in the hospital, traumatic delivery, couldn't walk for 2 week. He left the room when I was pushing to change his pants. Now I am left with bills for his lack of professionalism.",Male
She is extremely sweet! ,Female
Dr Paasch was my on call doctor for delivery. Having a different doctor  for labor was scary but  she made me feel very very comfortable and made my labor a smooth transition. ,Female
"Excellent office, best in Savannah. Dr. Paasch and Dr. Barrett and simply wonderful and I receive the best care from both! Office staff care and are efficient. ",Female
Could not ask for a doctor/gynecologist/person who makes you feel more comfortable or is more compassionate and seemingly genuinely interested in what concerns and questions you have. If only all doctors were as all-around amazing!,Female
Such a fabulous doctor!  Will keep her forever!,Female
"Unsatisfactory.  I visited Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN in July 2003.  I was desperate for a diagnosis and treatment of disturbing medical problems.  I returned to my home in FL without any significant answers.  In addition, the doctor indicated ""possible delusional disorder.  This was very damaging and prevented the early diagnosis and treatment of rare cancer that is also an orphan disease:  neuroendocrine tumor, carcinoid subtype, originating in the ileum.  I was finally diagnosed at stage IV in late 2004 and had major small intestinal surgery in June 2005.

A Mayo doctor identified the tumor in 2003; however, the recommended follow up was not done.  This is a slow-growing hormonal cancer that mimics other illnesses which may account partly for the delayed diagnosis.  However, Mayo's failure to follow up is unforgivable

I was diagnosed with a malfunctioning intrinsic factor leading to a myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed in 2014 and 2017, respectively.",Male
"He did get new reception staff which are way better than the past women with attitudes. His patients seem to be 1,000 years old and you can never get in and out. It seems like they're always behind schedule. His office is an old house in maumee and could use some tech and aesthetic updates. Another thing to consider, he does a lot of philanthropic missions, etc.- which means sometimes he's not there when you need him. They did finally get a PA to help with the workload and she's amazing.",Male
"Dr. Paat is incredibly caring, giving, and knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone!",Male
"I would recommend Dr. Paauw and Piedmont Eye to everyone needing eye care. From the COVID screener as you enter to the Doctor and his entire staff, you are met by friendly people whoi seem to genuinely care about you.

Many thanks to all of them.",Male

Dr. Paauw is amazing. With the help of God and his expertise my eye is so very much clearer. My vision has drastically gotten better. I loved the fact that he prayed for me before he did the surgery for cataracts and glaucoma. He is an excellent human being and an outstanding doctor!,Male
"I can see perfect now!
Dr. James Paauw and his staff were absolutely wonderful during my cataract surgeries! First, he diagnosed cataracts and glaucoma in both eyes. I am a type 1 diabetic who has kept myself almost complication-free for 50 years. My eyes are my very top priority! The procedures were almost painless—no big deal! (For the cataracts, ask for the spray on your hand for the IV!) For the cataracts, I was in and headed back toward my car in 1-1/2 hours. 

Dr. Paauw prayed for me before surgery; he is an humble, godly man.",Male
"As an ophthalmologist, I had the pleasure of referring patients to Dr. Paauw during his time in Kansas City, as well as consulting with him on patient care.  His knowledge of patient care was outstanding and complete.  His patients could tell how much he cared for them.  It was a tremendous loss to Kansas City when he left, though a tremendous gain for his new patients in Virginia.  He is wonderful physician and person.  I highly recommend him!",Male
I've been seeing Dr. Paauw for a while now for some eye problems related to chemo. He has been great handling things and even had to do an emergency surgery and i feel he handled my care really well. He and Dr. Vogel have been fantastic and i wouldn't go anywhere else.,Male

"About 5 years previous, I had cataract surgery from another surgeon.  I began developing floaters in my right eye, which made reading difficult.  Dr. Paauw utilized laser technology in a painless process that quickly resolved the issue.  I appreciated his professional efficiency and gracious manner.  He also followed up by phone after the procedure to check on my recovery.  I would highly recommend Dr. Paauw and his staff.",Male
Excellent group of eye doctors.  Dr. Paauw is personable and spends more time in the room than many doctors I have seen before.,Male
Great doctor and great staff.  Very friendly environment.,Male
I am a COA for Dr Paauw. I have been impressed with the care he gives his patients. I would trust him to care for my own eyes. Every year Dr Paauw does a mission trip to Haiti and has also helped fund me so I could go on a missons trip.,Male
"I encountered Dr. Paauw while he was filling-in for an optometrist.  He never indicated he was an ophthalmologist. His disdain for the menial task of writing prescriptions for eyeglasses became apparent after I had my pair made by my optician.  I could not see accurately through them.  I returned to Dr. Paauw and he would not modify his prescription.  He also refused to give me a report indicating that my glasses were manufactured incorrectly.  So, now I have $400 worth of useless spectacles.",Male

"Dr. Pabaney was wonderful when I had to have surgery.   He explained things clearly and answered all my questions.  During the 10 hour surgery, he kept my family updated and addressed all their concerns.  During follow up appointments, he spent the right amount of time with me.  I never felt like he was rushing off to see his next appointment.  His assistant, Jane, was wonderful too.",Male
"What an excellent doctor!  Dr. Pabaney is extremely thorough and attentive.  On my first visit, he asked a lot of questions and seemed to truly want to understand my health issues, rather than just putting me through the standard battery of tests. I had to have surgery and through that event and the associated follow up appointments, I’ve felt like his most important patient.  I highly recommend this doctor.",Male

However, I have nothing or no one with which to compare my experience.

I have subsequent procedures scheduled and looking forward to them",Male
Very knowledgeable and all around a great doctor ,Male
My grandson was born at 3.8 lbs on 12/4 and Dr. P was awesome. He is kind and considerate of family and does everything that he can possibly do to help the little ones. Thank God he was present because we needed him. Thank you.,Male
Did not spend enough time to diagnosis conditions. Seemed rushed and impersonal.  Had to go to another doctor to get both conditions diagnosed and treated.,Female
"The worst doctor I've ever had. The office is not good either. It reminds me of health central, back in the day. Health Central is closed now, and hopefully MMP closes soon too. Many of the same burned out, jaded doctors from HC practice at MMP.",Female
"Zero stars if I could. You'd be better off not having a doctor. All Pabbathi will do is berate you while she does her check up, then either do the incorrect diagnoses/treatment, or mess up the correct diagnosis/treatment. A completely incompetent doctor, and very mean and clueless in social aspects in addition. I talked with the office manager about how mean she was, so hopefully she gets fired soon. Avoid her more than the plague, as she'd probably ask why you were dumb enough to get the plague",Female
"My mom and I were 10min late today(most clinics have 15min late window), the receptionist refused to check us in saying she already left. When seeing us in the past, she was always in a hurry and never asked ""if there's any question"". My mom's neurologist ordered a blood test for diabetes and she said everything was normal whereas the neurologist said there were 2 standards used to interpret the result in which one of them indicated that my mom is pre-diabetic. I would NOT recommend Dr. Pabbathi",Female
"Dr. Pabbathi has been my physician since 2010. She is warm and friendly; I feel that she sincerely cares about me as her patient and as a person. She seems extremely knowledgeable about many fields of medicine. With every medical issue that I have confronted she has been able to diagnose and treat, send me for other tests and/or refer me for appropriate treatment. I feel completely safe, confident and comfortable in her care. I feel that in 76 years of medical care she has been one of the best.",Female
Not very thorough. Asking for a referral takes a few weeks for her office to respond and many follow-up. Not very responsible.,Female
She doesn't even know what Sjögren's syndrome is or interstitial cystitis or the medication I am on to treat either of them. I have diagnoses confirmed from 3 rheumatologist in 3 other states over the last 10 years and a specialist from London England but this woman swears they are wrong and she's the only one right when she can't spell the medication nor the name of the syndrome. I will never go back to her and recommend she go back to school!,Female
Love her she are a good doctor can't say nothing bad thanks for asking,Female
Terrible doctor. Tries not to admit anything. Bad bedside manner. ,Female
She helped me so much when I had cancer.  She a very good doctor.,Female
Dose'nt listen talks while you are talking and if you are persistent in trying to get her to hear and understand your health situation after all I was the patient she yells at me two visits with her and I was done.sit there let her dictate to you and not say a word she's fine never had a dictor like her before hope I never will again. Bad bedside manner,Female
Dr. Pabby performed two endoscopy procedures on me during the past couple of months following Roux-n-Y bariatric bypass surgery. Both included biopsies of my esophagus and dilations of both the jejunum-pouch anastomosis and my esophagus. The dilations completely resolved swallowing issues I was having. I found Dr. Pabby to be highly professional and courteous. He is an outstanding Gastroenterologist. Highly recommend.,Male
"Bedside manner lacks. Too quick, and dismissive. Ran out the door as she told me what she was going to do. Have had better dermatologists. Will not return. ",Female
When I saw her she was very attentive to all my questions and the issue I was being seen for. She also demonstrated vast knowledge and answered all my questions ,Female
"My first visit with Dr Pabilona and she seemed to be very interested in my health and what I had to say.  She explained things very clearly and appeared to possess extensive medical knowledge.  She also has a good sense of humor.  I hope she is happy in this practice, because the Doctors seem to come and go a lot.  I hope to be her patient for a long time to come.",Female
"I went in for a routine check up and she wanted to run every test under the sun on me. Instead of telling me it's routine she acts like you could potentially have all these problems, which is great for someone who has a fear of doctors. She did not make me feel comfortable at all. Then when I leave and look at the print out I was given, it has more tests that she planned to run on my bloodwork which she had not mentioned to me at all! Would not recommend!!",Female
"Dr. Matthew Pabis is by far one of the most amazing doctors I have been given the opportunity to meet. I consider it to be a blessing to have him as my primary doctor. He has a profound knowledge of medicine. Dr.Matt is clearly present with you during your session and does not push off medical concerns on other specialists.

He clearly explains what is medically going on and what your options are; alleviating medical concerns and anxieties. As a dedicated doctor by calling he takes the time to explain any question you have in a clear and precise matter. He is prompt, precise, diligent and knowledgeable; a true gift to the medical profession. 

In two words: Simply Excellent.",Male
The best in all capacities.,Male
"First, I'd like to respond to two other reviewers (Cicek Sepeti and ""a long term patient""). Wow, I was shocked to read your reviews and your thoughts that all the positive reviews of this doctor were false or fake. Considering both of your reviews were dated Oct. 14, 2019... would lend to the likelihood that your 2 negative reviews were contrived by the same individual and were deceitful and fictitious. Secondly, I am quite real and have no problem addressing any improprieties in any service I receive. I also believe one should commend individuals that provide great service. Therefore I felt compelled to write  a 5 star review dated 6/21/2017:  My husband and I found and followed him to his new location because Dr. Pabis is an excellent doctor. He is professional, knowledgeable, and kind.  Dr Pabis has a friendly, warm bedside manner and is really easy to talk to.  I had been looking for a good doctor for my husband who usually doesn't like doctor visits but he likes Dr. Pabis...STILL!",Male
"He is a simply unkind and untrustworthy practitioner. He was simultaneously over familiar and very cold. He did not follow up on any promise at any point ever, and always had some gaslighting excuse. Getting appointments was a nightmare. He was elitist and classist and disparaging when it comes to money issues (it is a low income clinic). A horrible betrayal of the position of doctor.",Male
"He was emotionally abusive toward me. I would not recommend him to anyone. He is not a safe, reliable, or kind person. I do not believe other reviews are real.",Male
"Just wanted to drop a note regarding Dr. Matt Pabis.  I just completed a thorough exam with diagnostic testing with Dr. Pabis.  He is a really good doctor that addressed concerns that I had been putting off. He’s a smart guy very knowledgeable and even does additional research (showed me what my tests were reading and why/what treatment plan he recommends for improvement. He impresses that he genuinely cares about his patients and treats you that way. 

",Male
"I was looking for a GP and have tried a few but none were individuals I ""clicked"" with. Dr Pabis is obviously a new breed of Docs that look at patients in a different way. We talked about my overall health in detail and I can finally say this is the Doctor for me. Great, genuine personality that cares and took his time getting to know me. I didn't feel rushed and was comfortable opening up about my lifestyle without judgement. 
His expertise in all aspects was exemplary. Highly recommended.",Male
"For a short time I got to work with Dr Pabis at Fountain Medical Group. He insured me that he would help me and did just that he's very knowledgeable helpful and a great doctor to see and I recommend him, unfortunately I will not be seeing him anymore due to practice changes but I recommend him to anyone seeking help.

"He's a wonderful doctor, very smart, easy to talk too &amp; kind ",Male
"Made an appointment with this Dr. Pabla, gave my information over the phone, after getting there I was told they needed a co-pay of $175.00. A good office would tell you up front if you had to pay in advance. Most Doctor's are all about the money now days. Had they told me up front I needed $175 before they could see me I would have told them up front NO. What happen to billing patients. Unless you have money to give him up front I would not recommend this office.",Male
"Tore my Achilles Tendon Skiing earlier this year,  Had my Achilles Tendon surgery scheduled the following week,  I couldn't be more happier!  ",Male
"Worse doctor in the world, no bed side manners, all he does is write prescriptions and send you out the door, does not check you for problem and doesn't want to fix people, pill pusher",Male
"I Had a torn ACL in my knee. Dr. is very  Knowledgable, Finds &amp; figures out diagnosis. Had MRI same week of my initial consult. Then surgery the following week. Very Very satisfied ",Male
I have never in my life dealt with a DOCTORS OFFICE like this! it makes me sick! specially because i work with REAL doctors who have consideration for their patients not someone who got their degree at the corner store. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND PUT YOUR HEALTH AT RISK GOING HERE.,Male

"I have been under Dr. Pablo's care since March of 2019.  He is treating me for Prostate Cancer.  I was convinced after the initial consultation that Dr. Pablo was the doctor I wanted on my team of caregivers.

I have the utmost confidence in Dr. Pablo and an equal respect for the Nancy &amp; J.C. Lewis Radiation Oncology Center.",Male

"Dr. Pabon is an insensitive mental health provided.   My appointment was set up to see him nearly two weeks ago.  The actual time of the appointment was for 11:30am this morning.  At 12:15, I called his office, and I was told that he doesn't give specific appointments.  He basically calls when he wants to.   I have NEVER, in all of my years, experienced a doctor that doesn't give a specific appointment time. 
 Don't bother waisting your time with this individual.",Male
"I am 36 years old and my husband is 45.  We have two other children through IVF from another fertility center in Texas.  We are a military family and move quite often.   We wanted to add to our family while we are stationed in Florida.  I searched around for the right facility for our family.  I looked at a few local places but they weren’t personable.  I wanted a more intimate experience working with ONLY one doctor.  My Ob/GYN told me about Dr. Pabon’s practice so I did some research on his success rates and decided to give him a call to set up a consultation.  He is very personable and genuinely cares about his patients.  He listened to my past experiences of what worked for me and we made a game plan.  Due to my age, I decided to PGS test my embryo to try to avoid another miscarriage (had one back in 2017.) I am writing this with much happiness since Dr. Pabon helped me conceive.  I am currently 8 weeks along and he (and his staff) has helped me every step of the process. THANK YOU",Male

Our treatment was MESA/IVF/ICSI. had two egg retrievals due to the first round resulting in abnormal embryos. This hit me hard, but Dr. Pabon explained to me how normal it was and not to get discouraged. The second round proved his theory and I now have one in the womb and two on ice ;). The staff, Ashley, Yasmine, Liz, and Kelsey (sorry i know there were a few new girls and they were excellent too) always had a smile on their face, remembered my name, encouraged me. You all are a Godsend. I love you all. Thank you for what you do. You have made my dreams a reality. XO Lizzy G.

"I feel hurt, forgotten and ignored. We spent our life savings to have our surgery, later to find out that one tube is working the other is not. I tried to call Dr Pabon and his office so many times, and was guaranteed a call by his MA. I never got it.

There are many small touches that make a visit to Dr. Pabon' office pleasant, but three things stand out: 1) Dr Pabon's knowledge and skills, and the the technology he employs. His pregnancy rate in the first three months of this year was 92%; 2) Gentle hand. It never hurt when he does a procedure; 3) Excellent embryologist and support staff.",Male

She very nice and very down to earth if she can’t figure out some thing she will refer you out to a specialist to help,Female
"She is the absolute WORST. Save yourself years of wasted time, she is complacent and as the other reviewers stated, had little regard for patients.
 I have been complaining of symptoms for YEARS and instead of being proactive and ordering tests, she sits around doing absolutely nothing and even has to be told what tests to order. Maybe she truly has no idea as to what's going on medically or simply doesn't care about what patients have to say.
 I'm not sure how such complacent and frankly useless doctors are allowed to care for patients. I would give her 0 stars if I could since she has never been even remotely helpful as a doctor.",Female

"I was referred there by my doctor of 30 years.  I went twice and was treated with disrespect as though I was wasting their time.  No empathy for the pain I am in or the possibility this is a circulatory issue as explained by my doctor.   I have advised my clinic to defer any referrals to these people.  I paid for two appointments only to be trolled - but, in the end, they got their money.",Male
Excellent Dr. He knows what he's doing!! Saved my dialysis access MANY times in the past 15 years. He's not one who'll mince words. He'll tell you like it is. I appreciate that about him.

I was very comfortable with him and his candor. I was referred to him by another friend. I have seen my share of Doctors and even flew to see him from Texas. I am confident in his skills and will return to Chicago to be treated by him and his staff. The staff was prompt, friendly, and helpful. Kudos to a great first visit!",Male
I went to see Dr. Douglas Pacaccio for plantar fasciitis.  The pain got so bad that I could no longer play with my kids.  Dr. Pacaccio did wonders for me.  I am pain free and am back to running and playing soccer with my kids.  His staff was conscientious and very accommodating to my needs.  I highly recommend Dr. Pacaccio for any of your foot and ankle issues!!,Male
"I was referred to Dr. Douglas Pacaccio with Advanced Foot and Ankle Surgeons by a healthcare professional who was familiar with the condition of my feet. For 20 years I had seen various doctors/podiatrists and experienced little relief.

Dr. Pacaccio diagnosed the condition of my feet/ankles, clearly articulated available options, anticipated outcomes, and explained what my participation needed to be in  order to expedite the healing and rehabilitation process.  I'm happy to say that I am reasonably pain free and have returned to a physically active schedule somewhat ahead of schedule.

Dr Pacaccio's care, treatment of and concern for my issues, as well as treatment of me by his staff, are OUTSTANDING!  I would recommend AFAAS to anyone experiencing problems with their feet/ankles. Two locations made scheduling convenient.

My right foot was able to be stabilized with an orthotic and my left foot eventually required fusion at multiple locations and repair of two tendons.  THANK YOU!",Male
I had a ganglion cyst in my big toe that two doctors operated on without successfully removing everything. Dr Pacaccio was referred to me by another physician and from the first appointment I had faith in him and his staff.  I felt very comfortable and confident that my medical needs were going to finally get resolved!! I am so grateful for everything that Dr Pacaccio goes  above the standard care for his patients. I’ve referred his name to numerous people. I would  give them 10 stars ??,Male
He’s dr ever love the office and the dr. I have had one the most challenging cases for him to handle and he took it head on.  Will definitely go back. ,Male
Dr. Doug Pacaccio is absolutely amazing. I was incredibly nervous because this was my 3rd time having bunion surgery at 21 years old. He was reassuring and confident but also realistic and honest with my choices. Unlike my previous doctors I felt like I could really trust him and be honest with him. He has made the recovery as easy as possible. I highly highly recommend him to anyone!,Male
"Both Doctors care deeply about their patients! They have helped me beyond describable words. They literally saved my leg! They are so thorough, and take every precaution to give ""above and beyond"" care. 
Before, during and after surgery, they set your mind at ease. These two, and their knowledge base- are a true ""hidden gem"" here in Sycamore, Illinois!! ",Male
"I had several broken bones on my foot from a fall.  Dr.  Pacaccio  saw me immediately, and two days later  performed surgery.   My foot is doing excellent ........ thank you to the surgeon and his excellent staff!!!!!",Male
This is the best dr and office to go to. I have had one the most challenging cases for her to handle and she took it head on.  Will definitely go back. ,Female
Spends a lot of time with patients.  Very knowledgeable.,Female
"Well, I won't be going back to Dr Pacaccio.   They tried to double bill me by insisting that I pay my yearly deductible first, before even seeing the dr, and then rebilling me for the office visit &amp; dr's bill again.   Very shady billing system!  And then, Dr P talks extremely fast, and does tests &amp; procedures on anything she can think of (and outsourcing the results) so I was getting billed from 6-7 different labs, etc.      Will be finding a new podiatrist.",Female
"I am very cautious of providers: their display of capabilities, attentiveness, LISTENING skills.  So, when I encountered Dr. Adam Pacal, some ten years ago, I could not believe that he was real, except that the great patient care he provided the very first day, has evidenced itself on each visit. 

Dr. Pacal SEES ME, the person; is calm, relaxing, and serious about my well-being.  He never fails to knock and smile, upon entering.  He is competent and caring!  I recommend him highly, for your MD.",Male
"Dr. Pacal has been my primary care physician  for several years. His office staff is always friendly and helpful, and his nurse Nancy is so caring and returns my calls within 24 hours. I am very grateful for Dr. Pacal, his nurses, and his staff. Thank you for all your help!",Male
"In the beginning, Dr Pacal amd his first nurse were Great! His nurse understood being beatebeaten by a gang and having Alot of injuries. I thought he might help put a get well plan together for me. That was NOT the case. His nurse was replaced  by Nancy.  Nancy is not the Sharpest nurses since they are employed by Sharp Hospital. I needed a detailed letter on my disabilities. They could NOT give me that. BAK surgery L5S1 Replaced. BEWARE!! Xray needed. NO letter.",Male
" I knew someone who got very sick very quickly. He went to several different doctors with no results then he went to this doctor.  Finally somebody was in charge of his case who cared, had energy, and did what was possible to diagnose and treat him.  It turned out that nothing could have been done. But at least there was a Doctor Who knew what he was doing, cared about the patient and communicated with the family and friends. This is a rare talented and contentious physician. San Diego is lucky ",Male
"I recently moved to SD from NY about 2 years ago. Having had a wonderful primary care back home, I was afraid I wouldn't find one that compared. I immediately tried Scripps and found one there. After becoming dissatisfied with the different doctors I had there I decided to try Sharp. The level of care is a night and day difference. I was recommended to see Dr. Pacal from a friend. Let me tell you, I have found my new and permanent doctor! His demeanor is so caring and he goes above and beyond.",Male
Dr. Pacal takes his time and really listens to what I have to say. Extremely knowledgeable and a wonderful bed side manner. He is definitely one of the top Doctor that I have ever been to. ,Male
"After reading reviews on here 
I almost canceled my appt with Dr. Pacana!! So happy I didn’t.  She was wonderful friendly patient and very thorough . ",Female
"Lousy doctor. Does not show any interest to patient, so indifferent and pathetic, not sure why she is still on board healthy woman OB GYN Freehold NJ. Will ruin delivery  and endanger life of new born. Stay FAR FAR AWAY from her &amp; healthy woman OB GYN Freehold NJ . She seems technically deficient. My temperature was rising and water was broken still she did not recommend emergency C-Section. She also did not attend me in person during my delivery and sent the mid-wives instead. Lousy doctor.",Female
Read from the wrong chart!!! If I hadn't questioned the information she was spouting she would have sent me to the hospital to receive an RH shot that was unnecessary!!!! Really concerning and very impersonal experience.,Female
She's wonderful,Female
"Dr. Pacana is a wonderful doctor and person.  She always takes time to make me feel comfortable, and will ask questions about my children (she delivered one) and my family, remembering things in detail.  She is extremely intelligent, but is still able to explain things to you in a way you understand.  She takes time to answer each question, and tries to show compassion for any issues.  She is also very gentle.  Fantastic doctor overall!",Female
"horrible bedside manner and couldn't be more obvious how little she cares. Ask her about birth control pills and she will tell you weight gain is a myth. Almost 10 pounds and 3 weeks later, she's proved a liar. How about a disclaimer next time? You MAY gain weight depending on your body's response, so one can make an informed decision. I specified any weight gain could not be tolerated at this point in my life and she assured me birth control pills don't do that anymore. don't trust her!",Female
"I had a colonoscopy yesterday and this is of course a very sensitive  procedure to have.  At his office everyone there was very helpful and made me feel at ease.  That is not an easy thing to do for that particular procedure. I have problems with my back and neck and they took a lot of time and afford to afford me comfort.  The staff was very upbeat and made the mood happy and upbeat.  I was given a great IV which completely knocked me out and when I opened my eyes again it was all over.  There was not any pain, terrible gas or anything unpleasant. The staff followed up calling me later to check on how I was feeling.  Anyone who has doubts about having this procedure should see Dr. Pacana and his office and they will have nothing to worry about",Male
He is caring and knowledgeable in what he does. He explains things in simple terms. I highly recommend him.,Male
"Awesome Doctor, very patient, very personal, very positive and a very funny guy. And, a Great Surgeon.",Male
"Totally awesome in all areas. Service, attentive, went in before actuall appointment.",Male
Very personable and well skilled in his specialty. Took the time to explain why he is referring me for evaluation of another issue.,Male
Dr. Pacanowski is a very friendly and helpful person who takes time to listen to the patient and offers excellent advice that is easy to understand. He is compassionate and really cares about the wellbeing of his patients.,Male
"With all my heart I would recommend Pima Heart, Dr Pacanowski and his team of providers and staff. They genuinely care and have a high standard of of services.  For me I was given back my life, my livelihood and my health. Most Dr's would have not had the dedication to see my surgery through. I was a mess inside and had complications from an old accident. Every step of the way and each member of the staff at Pima Heart was kind and professional and dedicated to helping me through some of the most challenging times of my life. I attribute much of that to Dr. Pacanowski's Leadership. Thanks to everyone that helped me get fixed I now am feeling myself again and looking forward to the rest of my life. I am free of pain, I am free from the burden of not knowing how I was going to provide a good life for my family. My family and friends and self will forever be grateful. Thank You Dr Pacanowski and Pima Heart for caring. 100%",Male
Good visit. Had ultrasound week before and got a good report. Surgery 2 weeks before solved walking problems.,Male
Dr. Pacanowski is an excellent physician with superb bedside manner. ,Male
"My mother hit her leg which caused a huge cut. We tried everything to get it to heal and she eventually gave in to see a doctor. We saw Dr. Pacanowski and he is very personable and explained things well about the procedure she needed done. The place she had it done on River road was a little hard to find, but very nice and worth going to over a hospital. The staff is very friendly and attentive there. The cut finally healed! I would recommend him to anyone.",Male

"Everything was amazing, from arrival time to being seen... well clean office and equipment.. friendly staff...professional doctor.",Male
"He is the best! His calmness, rationale, and astute understanding are true attributes of a skilled professional.",Male
"He’s an excellent doctor.  But, his practice is over-booked and highly inefficient.  Today, I arrived for my appointment at 3:00pm and waited 45 minutes to be seen for an initial exam by a staffer.  Then I waited another 30 minutes for a retinal scan.  After that, I waited a full hour before seeing Dr. Paccione.  
2 1/2 hours from arrival to departure is outrageous. If his practice were better managed, I would give him 5 stars.  He’s lucky I’m not giving him just one!",Male
Very long wait to see the doctor when a patient has  a scheduled  appointment ,Male
great doctor. my vision came back instantly after operation,Male
"I first met with Dr. Paccione about four years ago when my retina became detached.  I remember telling him I just want to see my grandchild with both eyes.   I was blinded in my left eye.  After speaking with Dr. Paccione who explained what the procedure would be I was in such great spirits.  After the surgery I regained my sight!!! I cannot thank Dr. Paccione enough, he’s top notch, the best and he really cares about his patients.  God Bless him always.
                         ",Male
"Dr Paccione is excellent, but office staff are dysfunctional and rude..No idea of customer service..you could wait upto 3 hours in the office because of overbooking. And number of parents..",Male
"Dr. Paccioni is an excellent Doctor. He is skilled and very thorough. Great bed side manner. Additionally, his staff make you feel at home. A+ to Stony Brook Medicine for retaining Dr. Paccione.",Male
I had abdominal surgery performed by Dr. Paccione three years ago.  It was completely successful.  He patiently described my problem and the procedure he would perform.  He checked on me regularly and answered all my questions post-op.,Male
"doctor was great!! however a lady in the front office gave me a hard time. I needed fmla /intermittent (unpaid leave) forms filled out to protect my PT job &amp;she gave me a hard time. Was told the dr would not fill that out for time off &amp;would not be able to call me in regards to the matter either. I’m a single, pregnant woman who works 13 hr days 6 days a wk, it’s draining. I simply wanted my job protected for the days I’m physically unable. I should not leave the dr office more stressed.",Female
I looooove Dr. Paccione! She has the best bed side manners and she really cares for her patients! I’m glad I lucked up on her when I was searching for a gynecologist. ,Female
"I can't say enough about Dr. Paccione. I drive out of my way to see her for all of my visits.

Her bedside manner takes the awkwardness away from any of my ""lady"" visits. She isn't smart, hilarious, and just honest. She helped me figure out the birth control options best for me - being direct and open about her own experiences and recommendations for my health. 

I plan to see her for many years to come!",Female
"Scheduled at 15:00, probably the last patient she has seen. Waited more than 30 min before I was seen by Paccione. She was so in hurry to leave that she did not even keep me informed of what she was doing. Not even told me what type of ultrasound she was about to do and I wasn't expecting it there. The interpretation of the ultrasound was limited to everything is OK, did not say if there was a cardiac pulse or not. Did not even mention Zica virus risks in Atlanta. Was my first and last visit!",Female
"Dr. Paccione seems to be an excellent physician. I have only seen her a few times but she listens, asks the right questions and spends the necessary time.",Female
"If you call this clinic to schedule an appointment, you are unlikely to see this doctor.  Instead they refer you to one of their nurse practitioners.  The people staffing this clinic seem to be rushed, careless, and impatient, and do not take the time to properly diagnose their patients.",Male
I was in and out of my first appointment within 20 min which was perfect.   All my questions were answered and everything was explained to me.  Dr Aaron is so nice and very welcoming. I am glad I chose this place. My last dermatologist just assumed I have psoriasis and put me on Humira which did nothing but Aaron immediately wanted to do further testing to but sure it really is psoriasis before he treats it. I highly recommend this place!,Male
Superfine.,Male
"Fantastic expert--very personable, professional and an extremely well organized staff

Wow! Great doctor and staff! They go above and beyond for their patients. Dr. Pace and Angela answered all of my curious 8 year old's questions patiently and thoroughly. They even made him an extra foot mold to take home! I wish all doctors were this awesome!,Male
"Easy to schedule appointment, was seen very soon after arrival, and consultation was quick and efficient.",Male
Dr. Pace is a doctor with a great heart and a great human quality. He cares for his patients.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 2016 and he performed a left breast mastectomy without complications and with very good results. Also when I was hospitalized for an infection on my arm he was aware and transfer me to his department. All his staff are very professional and caring. Infinite thanks. Words will never be enough to demonstrate the level of gratitude I feel for you.,Male

"Dr.Pace is the MOST knowledgeable doctor in her sub field of bio identical hormone expertise, bar none. As a PRIVATE PRACTICE physician, not a part of a group practice owned by a hospital or corporation, she truly takes the time with patients as they need. BRAVO~ Dr.Pace. She's the BEST!!! I will never again go to any group collective ...private practice, where they don't herd patients like sheep, is where you'll get the best care and if only there were MORE like Dr. Pace!!  ",Female
"Dr. Pace is a nice physician, but her office staff are rude and lazy.  Their standard answer to everything is no.  I overlooked her waiting time, but in the aggregate, her services do not warrant the waste of my time and having to endure her staff.  ",Female
"My family and I were patients of Dr. Pace for a long time. Many of the little things we looked over were waiting consistently 30-40 minutes after your scheduled appointment, rude staff, and lengthy appointments. The time came for us to find another doctor last year. My mother came in with severe bloating, almost looking 9 months pregnant. Dr. Pace prescribed her diet pills. After several other doctors visits to hospitals my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. She died later that year.",Female
"I went to Dr. Carolyn Pace's office over a year ago, and at that time had United Health Insurance.  I was asked by my kidney doctor to go back to her for testing.  Her office took my copay, took a copy of my insurance card, and did not tell me at either appointment that I am now out of network.  I sat for over an hour at each appointment. Doctor Pace did not review my chart before she came in.   She ordered tests to see if I have Lupus.  When the test results came back, and it was evident she had not seen the results before.  She explained that most things in the results lead her to believe I do not have Lupus, except for one of the indicators on one of the tests.  She had to look up on Google, (in front of me) what one of the tests meant.  She said that she could not give a confirmation of what my diagnosis was.  I was then charged for out of network pricing.  I called to let them know they made a mistake, but they refused to take care of any of the charges. Terrible experience.",Female
"I was seeing Dr. Pace for well over a year and half I loved her at first, but then she started to get weird and said I needed god in my life, when I told her i wasn’t interested she kinda got upset. So I kinda just brushed it off. When I tried to make a follow up this year, I called in February to make an appointment the girl that answered the phone wants only rude but seriously incompetent. She said they’d give me a call right back, they had to check with Dr. Pace, but didn’t tell me why they needed too. I’m still waiting for a call back. Also this isn’t the first time I’ve been waiting for a call back, this is like the 5th time I was promised a call back. Don’t go to her, she’s not worth it",Female
"5 stars for Dr. Pace, but only about 3 for her office, which is pretty immature and incompetent.  She's good at what she does, very thorough and considerate, and explains everything.  Her staff, however, does a poor job of managing.  Every scheduled appointment involves a very long wait.  I was told this when she was recommended to me by a friend, so I expected it, but it's still very frustrating.  However, when you get past her staff to her, it's worth the wait.",Female
She doesn’t take my insurance but I pay 150cash to keep seeing her that’s how much I like and appreciate her services,Female

"Dr. Pace is wonderful. She was extremely thorough, went over all my history and symptoms, and was actually able pinpoint the cause of my pain. I've seen so many doctors over the past 20 years, and none of them were able to figure out what was causing my pain. A lot of them didn't take it seriously, or acted like it wasn't possible for me to be having such extreme pain.

"BEWARE!!! For all of you that are seeking DR Carolyn Pace to be your Rheumatologist.
Here is our story, Last year when East Valley rheumatology close their doors, I was was forced to find a new Doctor. We were one of the lucky few (unlucky as our case) to be accepted as a new patient. At first all was good, I was already on a RA medicine that was doing its job and things were great, but come January 1 2017, new insurance so that meant New Pre-authorizations were needed to continue with the curre",Female
"My mother has been going to Dr. Pace for years.  I am not sure why we have allowed my mom to stay as her patient.  Her staff is without doubt the worst staff a Dr. could have.  They do not return calls, they do not let you make another appointment while you are there.  Either they do not give her the messages you leave her, or she just does not bother to return your calls.  All in All, you get a real sense of ""we could car less"" from her and her staff.  We are currently looking for another Dr.",Female
"Has an email ""audition"" system as a way of stringing along potential new patients. Doesn't answer emails, refuses to schedule over the phone. Is NOT accepting new patients, so just move along, nothing to see here. Wait time? I've been waiting FOUR MONTHS to even get a ""we can't see you at this time"" message. So rude. ",Female
She was ok until I had a crisis and needed her help for the additional pain I was suffering.  Then she was suddenly and strangely unavailable.  She told her staff to tell me she was not there  (a lie).  Then she dropped me as a patient by mail.  She actually and for no reason accused me of selling the drugs she was prescribing for my fibromyalgia!  Stupid and uninformed.,Female
"The Dr's office staff is almost completely inept. The answering system, which is active 110% of the time, routes calls off into space. Calls are rarely returned timely. Sometimes not at all. Prescription refills are promised, but very rarely delivered without callback after callback.",Female
"Dr. Pace is the most patient-focused doctor I  have ever experienced. She allows a extended period of time for each visit. Not only does she actually READ the labs and paperwork ahead of a visit, but thoroughly reviews my immediate medical needs as well as the emotional aspects of having a chronic illness. Dr. Pace is professional, organized and respectful. I'd recommend her to anyone.",Female

"TRIED, TRIED, AND TRIED to make an appointment with Dr. Pace but was unable due to the WORST OFFICE STAFF ON THE PLANET !!! ",Male
"Been a long time patient of Dr. Pace.  I agree that it often takes a long time to see him, not only to get an appointment but in the waiting room as well.  However, to me he is worth the wait.  He is very thorough during his examinations, takes the time necessary to address your needs (probably why always running late on appointments), very pragmatic approach to urology, he knows his stuff and relates the information to patient in a way that is easy to understand.  You do not feel like he is talking down or pandering to you.  ",Male
"I've always found Dr. Pace to be very good during office visits.  I think he is over-subscribed - too many patients for his practice.  Appointments are almost always at least 3 weeks out, not good when one has an infection or is otherwise plagued by prostate, bladder or  other urinary issues.  Even followup to schedule a surgical procedure takes too long.  The added burden of corporate medicine has only complicated matters.  On a more personal note, after a five year hiatus, when I finally saw him, 6 weeks after I started having my current issues, I was shocked by his long, unkempt hair and beard. Today, I read that that beards harbor more bacteria than animal fur.  That is very distressing to one facing a TURP in the near future.",Male
I filled out my new patient packet bf my appt. They didn't submit the bill to insurance until 10 months after my appt and turned me over to collections for their error!

Dr  Qadeer did tele-medicine during that time, speaking to his patients every two weeks and prescribing their medications every two weeks.  He is a wonderful Doctor with a heart of pure gold.  I would recommend him to anyone, for his increedible talent, and expertise.  He is an incredible Doctor with a heart of pure gold.

Very truly yours,

Angela Lynch.",Male

I am still in the same pain as before and it gets worse with any movement now.....do not ever see this man.

Do not believe any positive comment,Male
Ive had the worst experience with this doctor he dismisses you. He does not listen to your problems. He thinks he can solve problems with medications. i waited almost 2 hours for him and he spent only 3 minutes in the room. His MA was nice he took his time to listen to my problems and wrote everything down but the doctor didnt even look at any of the paperwork I spent an hour filling out.,Male
worst doctor ever.,Male
he is the worst doctors i have ever seen. only spends 2 mins in the room but makes you wait for 2 hours,Male
"After about six months this guy just forgets about keeping track with current issues. I went in for Back, Neck, and knee. I had to tell him about my damn neck and back. So fixated on the knee not even looking at the MRI's this guy is trash. He doesn't listen. Even when you're changing Pharmacy's.",Male

I have been seeing Dr Qadeer for long time. Service is very quick. Wait no more than 15 minutes before I’m called in. He arrives shortly after. Very good mannerisms and explains anything you may be unsure about.,Male
I won’t recommend her at all due to the way she worked. She was my on call doctor for labor and delivery. It was almost time for her to go home but the baby wasn’t coming out fast enough. So she rushed me to push. The baby head was almost out but since she had only 20 min left till she had to go home. She cut me without even saying anything. I didn’t even know till after they were done putting stitches in,Female
"She delivered both my kids.  Both vaginal, with episiotomy.  She knows what she is doing.  They give information on whatever you need or are concerned about.  You have to remember,  she does this all day.",Female
"Dr. Qader sees me on a regular basis to treat a painful callus on my toe that sometimes gets infected and to cut my toenails. She is knowledgeable, professional and kind. She always takes the time to thoroughly examine and treat my feet and is not rushing to move on to the next patient. The office staff are also respectful and friendly. I would highly recommend Dr. Qader and Westchester Foot Care to anyone seeking excellent foot care.",Female
Outstanding dr. Very caring. Only saw him in a hospital setting bc my husband went into renal failure after a cardiac arrest induced by a massive heart attack. He is extremely smart but can relay info in layman terms. I think very highly of him.,Male
He had  a good bedside manner. I felt at ease when speaking to me. He carefully reviewed my case and wasn't rushed. I was very satisfied with him and requested to always be seen by this doctor.,Male
"Waittime a bit to long in exam room
",Male
Dr. Qader scheduled my appointments too far apart. 1 yearly. I had significant kidney damage that was made worse by my blood pressure being too high and going undetected for too long.  Then when it was detected Dr Qader did not take steps to get it under control.  Repeated calls to his office to report meds were not working met with no solution.  I ended up working with my primary care doctor to control my blood pressure and getting another kidney specialist.  I would not recommend Dr. Qader.,Male
"Wonderful man. Dr. Qadir saved my life, he is a phenomenal doctor. ",Male
"Dr is friendly, compassionate and knowledgeable. Administrators Anna and Carla were very helpful and dilegent on caring to meet my scheduling needs. I highly recommend.",Male
"Office does poor job of updating records. There is no nurse on staff. If you call the office pointing out their mistakes, they are very unprofessional.",Male
This guy and his staff are unprofessional and lack any concern for patients. Must be nice to make the sole purpose of your practice to be making money and not patient healthcare.,Male
"Staff is rude. She said I had to leave a message to make an appointment.
Nobody returns calls. 
This dr is useless. Looking for a different primary care physician and going to expensive walk in clinic in the meantime",Male
Dr qadir is very layed back has no interest in the patient.  They don’t respond to with follow up or messages.  The staff is very disrespectful. ,Male
Have been going to Dr. Qadir for many years and has always taken good care of my health issues.,Male
Dr. Qadir's staff is incompetent and his Office Manager Donna is nasty.  The office has lost my family's medical records.  I would not recommend. ,Male
This doctor said I’m fluent in Spanish and im 100% white. It was even checked off on the paper work that I’m WHITE NON HISPANIC and he put in an office note that I speak silent Spanish. He is rude and does not have good bedside manner. I was sitting in the waiting room for an hour then had to listen to another girl say how she was going to punch him in his face for being rude to her. The office is disgusting. There’s trash everywhere. The girls at the front desk are rude and literally have zero expression on their face. They look like they need a new job and a new life. Their misery just floods the waiting room. I would never recommend anyone to see this doctor ever...and tjis is coming from someone who works in healthcare. He treatment is unethical.,Male
"Dr Qadir and staff,realizing my husband would not be relieved from pain growing tumor in esophagus,answered the phone after hours,waited until I arrived at office,provided him with pain medicine approriate at this time of cancer treatment.I can not express my heart-felt gratitude!!",Male
"First and last appoinment today. Scheduled for 11am, arrived early and at 1:40pm was told the doctor had ""gone to lunch"" and would be back ""sometime after 2pm"" if I wanted to wait. IF?... Needless to say I would not recommend this practice to anyone, because they most definately do not care about you or your time.",Male
"A caring doctor ,wonderful bedside matters and he shows he care....All I can say is a wonderful Doctor ",Male
"Dr. Qadir is a good Dr, but his staff in the front are ghetto and nasty, mean. When you walk into the office it smells like BO.. ",Male
"On 2/02  I called  told the girl on the phone that I needed to be done by 10:30am because I had class she told me that I would be, .well needless to say I was not seen , I had to reschedule 2/23 , I did get to see the Doctor who was very nice . He wanted to schedule me for a procedure and said some one would call me. but if they don't call. I called 3/05 , 3/6 just to get a rude girl name Tasha. she was nasty , ignorant and unprofessional I work at Atlanticare and I have never been treated bad.",Male
Great and friendly doctor,Male
"I was under his care and he is not a good doctor. Very bad..., 
always in a rush. No patient care.,Don't ever go to this doctor.,  and yes he over talks you   Thankfully I found a great doctor and have never to see this jerk again",Male
"My Son was in Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and Dr. Aftab Qadir treated him for 8 days and NOT ONCE did he call and talk to us or give us any information about our Son. He drew blood and ordered test, but never told us results and when we had to transfer our son to a long term facility he didn't even send results. DO NOT SEE THIS MAN!!",Male
He doesn't listen well. Seems in a rush to get finished and over talks you. Find a different Dr.,Male
"I have been seeing Dr Qadir for a year. She is my primary physician. She is attentive, cordial, compassionate and listens to all my concerns, which are many. She gives solid recommendations, refferals and is timely in responding. I would recommend her skills to anyone.",Female
"She is a great doctor and very knowledgeable. In response to the other reviews: When you get a watt removed they freeze it..When you see a GP they refer you out, that’s their job. Those other reviews are bogus.",Female
"Extremely negative, would not recommend.  She either could not or would not fulfill her responsibilities as on call physician.",Female
I am writing this comment to help future patients out. I went in a few times and all the doctor does is refer out. The one time I have her do a simple wart procedure and she gave me frost bite.,Female
"Dr. Qadir has been my primary caregiver for years.  I trust her and know that she always has my best interest at heart.  It is comforting to know that when I meet with her, I never have to explain anything.  She's very intelligent and always abreast of the best treatment for my conditions.  I'm always amazed at her concern and the time she takes with her patients.  I highly recommend this very fine physician.  She selects wonderfully capable assistants also.
Linda H.",Female
She was very attentive and listened to everything I had to say.I will definitely go back the next time I need medical attention.,Female
Spends ample time and she good Docter,Female
"I have am chronically ill with multiple complicated illnesses and have had very bad experiences with Drs.  Dr Qadir has treated me with so much kindness and respect. She is knowledgeable and always willing to send a referral to excellent specialists.  She is very thorough and never makes me feel silly or stupid.  The best Dr I've ever had, and I've had many. ",Female
Always a long wait and never very friendly.  ,Female
"I have been a patient over 15 years, wouldn't go anywhere else! Dr Qadir truely cares about her patients well being and ensures she addresses all issues and all of your concerns at each and every visit.",Female
This physician is horrible. If you care about your health don't go to her.,Female
Awful every single appointment he is at least 40 minutes late. Why even make an appointment. Very impersonal,Male
Dr. Qudar is a compassionate doctor who listens intently to her patients. And truly wants to help her patients get and feel better.,Female
"Excellent doctor. One of the best we have been to. Great listener, very caring , very knowledgeable. We come all the way from Missouri to see Dr. Qadir and would drive even further if we had too.",Male
"I have had two very bad experiences with this doctor. Last year after a colonoscopy, I was bleeding excessively after a a routine polypectomy when I had never had any rectal bleeding...ever, before this time; I talked to other people who had the same procedure and none of them reported this same result. Also, I had new damage after a routine rectal exam this last February. I would recommend him to no one!  ",Male
Dr. Qadir is an excellent listener and clinician.  He is current on the literature and was able to solve my problem when 2 previous gastroenterologists could not.  His office staff is friendly and helpful.  I would go out of my way to see him.,Male
"I recently moved from Naperville, IL to the Kansas City area. Because of Dr. Qadir's throughness, I do not have colon cancer today. Due to my consistent gastric complications, which were monitored by Dr. Qadir, he performed a colonoscopy five years after my first, not the recommended ten. Thank God for his medical expertise and knowledge. My biopsies were not good and with his care I'm still alive and well! Terri M.",Male
She is awesome!  ,Female
Ive been waiting for 45 minutes in waiting room and still waiting. Its rude to patients to keep them waiting this long.,Female
Did a phone visit as my first visit. Was rude and condescending plus did not listen just disagreed with everything I said.  Also disagreed with all of the other medical professionals who saw me in the hospital.  Chastised me like I was 18 years old (am 70).  Will never make another appointment or ever recommend!,Male
"Dr. Qadir performed my recent colonoscopy-he was very kind, explained findings and very courteous and personable.  I would definately recommend Dr. Qadir highly!",Male
"He is awesome, except if you need him when you have a flare up all you get is recordings!!! For me that's enough to change doctors. If you cannot talk to a human when issues come up that might make me upset enough to change doctors. !!! That needs to change!!!",Male
"Dr.Qadir is very attentive to your ""personal"" needs as well as health.  I don't care much for the lady that comes in before him. She as a ton of questions to which I don't think she's got a valid answer to any question. You can believe Dr.Qadir is going to find your problem an treat it.  Highly recommended.",Male
"was patient of Dr. Qadir  had pernious anemia  got  b12 injections, was tested in hospital  had antibodies issues absorbing b12 so needed shots for rest of life, he told me in the beginning b12 was safe can't get to much several years to build up and then I had a test with him and he said my b12 level was way to high now up to 15,ooo  needed to stop shots that it would be years before I would need them again. 12 weeks later b12 at 200 family doctor said I need b12 shots,",Male

I am amazed at Dr. Qadir's accolades.  He's excelled wherever he goes.  Thank you, Dr. Qadir and your wonderful staff.",Male
"Today, I went to see Dr. Rabah Qadir for my one year follow up after hip replacement surgery.  I had the first surgery in April of 2019, and the second one in July, 2019.  Both surgeries went extremely well with no side effects and no complications.  After the second surgery and the recommended physical therapy I was discharged after just two weeks!!!   Dr. Qadir is a brilliant surgeon who clearly cares for each and every one of his patients.

His office is so well managed that I have never waited longer than 10 minutes to be called back to begin the visit.  In fact, they called me back today before I completed the two pages of information they requested.  His staff is professional yet friendly and extremely efficient. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Qadir for your orthopedic care.  I told him that he gave me my life back!  For that I am extremely grateful!",Male
"Dr. Qadir did a total hip replacement using the Anterior procedure.  Stopped using a walker in less than a week,  Using stairs in 2 weeks without any pain.  Doctor spent quality time pre-op and answered all questions.  Cleared me to play tennis and golf after 2 weeks.  Outstanding  surgeon",Male
"Dr. Qadir was referred to me by another doctor; and I am so grateful for that.  Immediately I felt confidence in him.  He's easy going, has a big smile, and you feel he's sincerely listening to you, about your concerns.  I met with him 3 times and always felt the same.  My surgery was very successful.  I was right to trust him, and I would quickly recommend him to anyone needing medical care.  The assistant with Dr. Qadir was also very impressive.  He talked with me before the appointments with Dr. Qadir and explained again what to expect.  He also made me feel comfortable about the proceedings.  He is a good complement to  Dr. Qadir.",Male
Very arrogant with a demeaning pre-op bedside manner.,Male
I had knee surgery last year. He explained every step completely. Very compassionate.  I wouldn't recommend any other doctor for a knee surgery. He's the BEST!!,Male
"Had full right hip replacement on Monday August 19th, only used the walker for 2 days. I am at my ten day post-op appointment pain free with almost full range of motion, just minor bruising and swelling remains. Don't put off hip surgery, it is a fabulous recovery!",Male
Dr. Qadir is fantastic!  Having broken both lower bones in my left leg just below the knee Dr. Qadir was able to secure my leg first by stabilizing the leg for a week then repaired it with a plate and screws. Dr Qadir always has been genuinely interested in my progress from the start.  I am totally able to walk again! Praise god and Dr. Qadir! I highly recommend if you need a surgeon go see Dr. Qadir.,Male
"Dr Qadir is an excellent surgeon and post-surgery care doctor.  He takes the time to listen to concerns and questions.  He is always pleasant to talk with, gives quality care, and made my whole healing process easy with giving me the information and recommendations necessary.  I highly recommend him.",Male
"Highly recommend Dr. Qadir to all my friends and family. He and his staff are very friendly, professional and caring. Met Dr. Qadir at the ER at Memorial Herman after a fall off my bicycle where he performed surgery on my broken wrist and knee. I was frightened and he was very patient with me! I have a complete recovery, no problems.",Male
"Dr. Qadir was very thorough in his diagnosis and explanation of my medical procedure. He did a great job in the surgeries I had and I am back to normal. The followup was a breeze and I have full range of motion after the surgeries. A speedy recovery, and pain-free living are great.",Male
Dr. Qadir was very competent and kind.  He has the best assistants I have ever encountered.  They met every concern the same day I called.,Male
"I have had two hip replacements performed by Dr Qadir.  Both were very successful and exceeded my expectations.  My quality of life is back to normal.  No restrictions!  Dr Qadir and his staff not only kept myself and my family fully informed during the whole process. They answered any questions clearly and showed great care and concern.  I have and will continue to recommend Dr Qadir and his staff to anyone I know is in need of orthopedic needs.

Thanks!",Male
"Dr Qadir's knowledge and expertise is beyond words. I was treated with professionalism and care. After a serious car injury where other doctors estimated my return to work and the gym to be about a year, under Dr Qadir's care i was back in 6 momths.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",Male
Very informative and understanding and caring. Did a wonderful job.,Male
"I sincerely say THANK YOU to Dr. Qadir and the entire staff for their incredible help in giving me my life back with my left knee replacement!

"had both hips replaced 2 years ago, right  one first and 6 weeks later had the left one done, with each follow up vist Dr Qadir was very professional and helpful at answering any questions i had and took his time and never seemed in a hurry to get out",Male
"I am so thankful for Dr. Qadir and Josh.  When I was injured on the job playing tug of war with my students, they fit me in for surgery asap when they saw my injuries.  Through the workers' comp being stingy with physical therapy, Josh was always willing to call and get me more sessions that were necessary.  Thank you for your care, gentlemen!",Male
beyond good,Male
"the entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. the xray text don   had incredible bedside manner. Jose and Kimberly took great care of me while they did tremendous job taking my old cast off and putting a new cast. i was very happy with the entire experience. sincerely, stephanie hillberry",Male
I really like Dr. Qadir. She seems more knowledgable than other Doctors and gets to the point. She asked me questions about how I am doing at home and we always review any issues that were discussed at the last appointment. I highly recommend!,Female
"Dr. Qadir is excellent.. Knowledgeable.. Caring.. Understanding and does everything, to help you.. The best..",Female
"I found her to be an excellent listener, very thorough and equipped with insightful suggestions.  She was intelligent and kind.  I have already recommended her to others.",Female
"She is very smart, insightful and caring, She listened, then came up with a well thought-out plan to deal with my issues.",Female
Loved her. Very caring. I have a lot of health issues. I feel she went above and beyond in her care. Received great care. So sorry to find she moved to Lansing area.,Female
"Dr. Qadir is one of the few physicians I've encountered who spends time face-to-face with her patients. She looks me in the eyes instead of checking boxes off on a computer screen. I felt like she got to know me as a person instead of just getting to know my symptoms. 
 
On top of that the office staff is attentive, friendly, and compassionate. I always look forward to seeing the ladies of this office! ",Female
She was very rude. Talked down to me. Didn't seem like she cared one bit. Will not return.  Very disappointed.  Office staff is great and the gal that does the vitals. ,Female
"0%
She was condescending. She yelled at me for doing the blood tests I had orders for before she took over my previous Drs. patients. I have had a heart attack and she asked me no questions. I needed an exam for my insurance and all she did was a breast exam. She refused to do a pap smear and I asked her why. She said she doesn't do anything she doesn't have to. I don't know what the new rules are and there is more. I don't feel like she wanted to get to know me and I don't feel safe in her care",Female
"I joined Dr. Qadir's program last Fall and finished up this Spring.  I have been delighted with her help and coaching each month.  She helped me with my diabetes, with gerd
for which I no longer need medication, with arthritis, and other problems.  I always thought I ate healthy, but following the diet she gave me I was able to get off of insulin, and many other  health problems are improved.  I would certainly recommend her program.  I looked forward to monthly coaching visits with her, which were so helpful in a very relaxed setting.  I still take the supplements as they give me so much more energy.  Another plus was losing weight.  
Thank you so much Dr. Qadir.  MG",Female
All she wants to do is sell supplements which are costly and do not work. She told me to stop eating butter...lol Was against female hormones...which are like our batteries by the way...,Female
"Without Dr. Qadir's help, I would never have seen the improvement in my health I have today.  She listens, is creative and brilliant!  All one needs to do is follow her plan to wellness.  It takes 2!  If we want wellness we must be willing to do our share.  Her staff is encouraging and very helpful.  Dr. Qadir is a healer who wants wellness for people, and is not in the ""business"" of medicine.",Female
"  A year ago, a skin allergy erupted over my scalp, back, legs, and arms. The itching was intolerable. I drew blood scratching. I lost hair scratching.
  I came to Dr. Qadir for help. She listened to me, and she started me on a course of treatment that made my skin and scalp healthy once again. Plus I feel more energetic than I have in several years.
  I was thinking this morning about the dramatic difference in my health from last year. Thank you, Dr. Qadir!",Female
Dr. Qadir has been a huge help to me. She listens intently to what my symptoms are and works tirelessly to find a solution. One of the best doctors I've ever worked with. ,Female
Dr. Qadir is extremely knowledgeable in a wide array of medical topics.  She has been patient with me allowing me to exhaust all questions I have had and never rushing through an appointment to get to the next.  The impression I get as a patient is that she genuinely wants to help me.,Female
"Very Rude, Sold Me supplements I Did Not Need, very long wait in exam room",Female
"Both visits had me waiting quite some time, but the second appointment had me waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes for ten minutes with the doctor.",Female
"She takes time to discuss options and focuses on what is important to YOU, not just pushing you along a visit. Recommend.",Female
"Dr. Qadir is a knowledgeable, caring, and holistic family medicine practitioner. Excellent bedside manner.",Female
Wonderful caring doctor!  I have been his patient for many years and would recommend him wholeheartedly.  I send my family and friends to him and they all love him too!,Male
Complete arrogant jerk. No compassion for the developmentally disabled.  Do not recommend him. Go somewhere else.,Male
Not a very good experience:(,Male
"BEWARE! He does not deal directly with you unless he feels like it. His office leaves you without your required prescriptions for almost 3 months!! $1,200 will buy you being passed off to office staff and a clinic that anybody goes to anyway. WHAT A WASTE!!!",Male
Dr Sofia Qadir is a mentally sick women mistreating patients . Never  answer calls of patients . She has a bad insulting attitude Dr Sofia is always late . She does not want to listen to the medical problems of her patients . She has got an insulting and harsh attitude towards patients . She like to threaten her patients . Her patients once start getting treatment know she will not listen to their complaints even if they get reactions by her medication . Dr Sofia Qadir bad attitudes make patients very uncomfortable . Dr Sofia just believes in her and her family quality time . She is always worried about her parties and her kids functions she ignore patients and she think it’s not important for her to check patients complaints . She says to patients you have mental health issues so I don’t want to get in to your matters . Dr Sofia Qadir has a very mean insulting attitude . She has no value or respect of her patients . She is always interested in billing and charging patients . Not Good,Female
Dr. Qadir was very pleasant and helpful,Female
Dr. Qadir is a friendly and kind doctor. She will work with you to get your situation resolved and was able to help me recover from depression after years of struggling with different doctors. I'm not sure what some of these bad reviews are about,Female
She made me feel like an experimental monkey in a cage. Nightmarish black magic in my opinion!,Female
Did not leave feeling comfortable at this place. Dr hardly spends time with you.,Female
Run! Literally the most uncaring doctor you will ever meet. ,Female
Most awful physician I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Do not trust her with your child. She should have her license for treating adolescents revoked. She has no idea about incorporating families into crisis plans of care nor does she care to. She made the most awful situation I've ever lived through 10000 times worse. South Seminole behavioral center needs to revamp their policies for families in crisis. Ask about them before you consider even setting foot there. Negative 5 stars,Female
"Rude staff and they don't take Medicaid. They don't call if they change the appointment. They have a nasty attitude and Dr Qadir doesn't care. She seems to only be interested in insurance money and not the patient's welfare. I switched Dr's an am now happy. I am so glad the nightmare that is Sofia Qadir *Cough Cough* MD is over. Needless to say, I do not recommend this psychiatic office. They are unprofessional and you will be dissapointed.",Female
"I first went to this Dr in November of 2020, because I needed a physical. The medical assistant performed 90% of the physical, and the Dr spent literally under 4 minutes with me, through which she rushed through her basic questions and did not allow for me to fully explain or ask anything in additional. This Dr over-books and does not care to listen to her patients, which could be somewhat justified if at the very least she would provide full and thorough medical advise. Two weeks after my physical I had to return to this office because I wanted a covid test, and all urgent care places had very long waits. The Dr provided no guidance or instructions on when I would be considered non-contagious, nor when she would advise to be tested again, or even if that’s necessary. Her receptionist was consistently short and rude each time I called to try and speak with the Dr after being in quarantine for over three week. It’s a shame that a so-called healthcare provider cares only about money.",Female
"Dr. Qadir has been an inconsistent doctor - I've been a patient for around 5-6 years and at the beginning found that she was exhaustive in her testing.  Her nurse/aide was a complete pleasure to see and spend time with, love her.  Dr. Qadir's care however has really dropped off in quality - in later years, the time together was rushed, sometimes she shunts me off to a different doctor, I don't feel like I'm being heard, and today she cancelled my appointment, refusing to listen to me.  Now I'm hearing from friends and acquaintances how they have had horrible experiences with her and are finding new doctors.  I wish I had realized sooner.  I'm done with Doctor Qadir, absolutely frustrated and upset.",Female
there is no communication between the doctor and the front desk,Female
I've been seeing Dr. Qadir for almost a decade.  Her team is friendly and efficient.  I recommend her 100% to anyone who is looking for a professional Dr.  who treats her patients with care and concern.,Female
"While personable,  I found her to be uninformed and somewhat insecure and defensive. On top of that, it took her two months to call the pharmacy with my Rx.  I called daily about it for a week then went elsewhere and got what I needed phoned in the same day. Two months later I get a call from the pharmacy telling me my Rx was ready. That’s how I know it took two months for her to call it in. The pharmacy said it was called in earlier that same day from her office. I no longer needed it.  She has also made mistakes on my husbands meds. She doesn’t really listen and seems unconcerned. She is great for the first appointment in terms of engagement then she could care less. Never gets back to you for info or follow up. You have to call several times to get a response. ",Female
"Terrible. She rushes through your appointment. She does not follow up with results. When you call to speak with her regarding health concerns, she has her office staff, who have no medical training, call you back. They also had mixed up information regarding my health history. The quality of care is very concerning ",Female
"Its true - she really is a bad doctor.  I went to her about a serious sore throat that would not go away for 2 weeks.  She diagnosed it as ""not strep"", therefore it must be that I need a nasal wash!  I went again a week later.  She refused to prescribe antibiotics (i.e., a Z Pack) or even do some tests to see what it might be.  She's too busy.  Barely 5 minutes of her time and kaching, she's made her money.  Sonia Qadir is a walking failure.  You might get lucky with her but broken clocks...",Female
Dr Qadir provides excellent care and guidnce.,Female
"I have been coming to Dr qadir for abt 3 years and I have had a few med issues that sometimes require me to visit 1x a week for Dr. Qadir to help me. Dr.Qadir, Cathy, Fran ,Maria and Michelle are awesome. They are patient with me. When I call for medication refills it is done immediately and  Dr. Qadir works with my other dr. to make sure I get proper care. I can honestly say This team is works together to give great care. I would recommend anyone looking for a.DR to call and set an appt.",Female
Love this office and staff!,Female
Very rude!  Very unprofessional!!! I definitely would not recommend her!,Female
Dr. Qadir is one of the most helpful and insightful doctors I've ever had an experience with. Her staff is fantastic. Her office is always very clean and the wait times are very short. I would definitely recommend her to any friends or family. ,Female
Dr. Qadir has been my physician for the past 11 years. I’m very pleased with my experience and highly recommend her to my friends and family.,Female
"In my 57 years I have had great doctors an some not so great, but Dr. Qadir is the least interested in her patients welfare that I have ever met.",Female
"Dr. Qadir is a very direct provider- she tells it like it is.  If you want someone to explain in detail and walk you through health issues, I recommend going to a specialist. She is nice, but blunt. She does seem a bit rushed until you engage her in a dialogue and ask questions, she will give you answers but you have to come with information. The staff is super responsive and the medical assistants are wonderful! I have never had to wait long and the office is never overcrowded which is nice.",Female
"Dr. Qadir is not only a great professional practitioner, but patient and caring.  She takes the time to explain why you are having the symptoms you are having and how to best remedy the health issue.

She has always provided the utmost care to me and my family.  She is a professional that can be trusted.",Female
I'm so happy to of found a doctor who is genuinely concerned about my well being and is quick about getting to the bottom of my issues she immediately sent me to her husband's hospital for MRI's to be done same day!!! her bed side manner is excellent and her staff is friendly. I am confident Sonia Qadir will fix me and in a timely manner so I can get back to my 5 children and husband. Thank you for showing me kindness that alone gives me peace of mind.,Female
Great doctor. She genuinely cares about her patients. Recommended her to my entire family. ,Female
she will walk that extra mile for you and she takes the time to explain so that you leave with understanding of your condition and options.,Female
"Dr Qadoom is possibly the most disrespectful, gruff, arrogant, and self-centered doctor I have ever used. His staff constantly is turning over, I never see the same nurse. I overheard him yelling at the front desk lady and I felt so uncomfortable walking out afterwards. Every time I have seen him I wait forever in the waiting room and then I see him for less than 2 minutes. The front desk people are clueless about anything other than trying to schedule me for another appointment so he can get more money. Safe yourself the time, effort, and frustration and go see a doctor that cares about his patients and employees. STAY AWAY FROM DR DOOM",Male
"I warn everyone about Dr. Quadoom and his office help. One year ago I was forced to go cold turkey from a schedule 2 sleep drug I had been on for 4 years. Called several times over a period of 3 days telling their staff my last pill was going to be February 27th.  On February 28th I got a call back from a male at10 till 5 telling me that Dr. Quadoom would see me the following Monday. I knew that was it, I would have to go cold turkey from this drug that evening. Withdrawal was long and hard.",Male
I cannot explain how much I enjoyed my visit.I've gone to at least 4 doctors and not a single one knew how to help me yet my first appointment with Dr.Qadoom and he could instantly pinpoint the problem.He is very knowledgable and you can tell that he's extremely professional.He seemed to have a vast amount of experience and he truly was a joy.The receptionists were also very helpful with any questions I had!,Male
Dr. Qadoom is very approachable and listens to his patients. He is very knowledgeable in his field and has made a huge difference in my overall health and quality of life!,Male
"I had a good experience,the staff was super friendly and kind,I didn't even wait more than 5 min after walking ,Dr.Qadoom invited me inside, got all my information and helped me out better than my last 4 doctors that could not understand what my problem was. The moment I told him my symptoms he knew exactly what my problem was and gave me a home sleep study test that showed I had sever sleep apnea and he prescribed me a C-pap that helped me get rest I haven't had in 5+ years.RECOMMENDED FOR ALL.",Male
He was the kindest doctor I've ever had.,Male
He's A Joke. He Has Sold Out To Insurance Company's.,Male
"Awful!! Worst doctor ever. I saw him due to a snake bite and all he said was ""rest, dont keep it elevated"" All while my leg was turning blue. I had to get transferred to the ICU later that night. He is HORRIBLE. He lacks communication and doesn't understand anything you say to him. If you need medical attention, do not let him be your doctor. Pure NEGLIGENCE",Male
The worst doctor's office and staff I've ever encountered in my entire life! My husband has special needs disabilities. AWFUL. RUN DON'T WALK AWAY from this doctors office.,Male
"This Doctor really cares about his patients! I have been through so much with my Mom's recent illness and Dr. Qadri has been a God-Send when other doctors wouldn't care or listen.

"HE SAVED MY LIFE!  
FOR THE LAST 8 YRS I HAVE BEEN SEEN  FOR MY LUNGS. I HAD A KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERY AT MEM. HERM. HOSP. THE SURGERY WENT BAD! I HAD BLISTERS ON MY LEGG THE SIZE OF BOILED EGGS. SENT TO HELTH SOUTH THEN HOME. MY FOOT STARTED TO TURN BLACK 3 DAYS LATER. WENT TO M- HERM SW AN NE ER'S WHERE I HAD MY SRURGY AND TURNED AWAY. I WENT TO KINGWOOD AND WAS ADMITTED EMEDENTLY.  I WAS SEVERLY INFECTED AND ALMOST DIED IF IT HADENT BEEN FOR DR QUADRI! HE IS A FANTASTIC DR
MAY GOD BLESS YOU!",Male
DR QADRI IS A VERY CARING PHYSICIAN. HIS CARE IS EXCEPTIONAL!,Male
"He lacks communication skills which are needed when there are serious health issues. He may think he has done his duty by diagnosis and treatment but fails when he refuses to answer questions about patient management which can affect someone’s life. He seems to lack any empathy. Ask yourself do you want a doctor who acts like you have no right to know about your condition or treatment.? So when something is amiss , you can only be afraid Bc the doctor will REFUSE to address your concerns ? There",Male
awesome doctor! so kind and considerate,Male
"My family and I have been with Dr. Quadri for over 12 years.  What very smart Doctor who is honest, caring and always wants the best for his patients.  He cares and listens to his patients on every visit.  Professional bedside manner.  He takes care of all three generations of my family. Exceptional Physican.",Male
"Dr. Qadri probably literally saved my wife's life.  He identified a bacterial infection in her intestines where all the other doctors had missed it.  He took my wife's case at the hospital, after we fired her primary doctor there, without hesitation or question.  Dr. Qadri takes time to listen and ensures you understand the issue.  He is very knowledgeable and cares for his patients.  We were so impressed, we are planning to switch our primary care physician to him.",Male
"Dr Qadri is the best doctor I've ever come across to, he really cares about his patents and really gives them the time and affection they need. i highly recommend this doctor!",Male
"He is a big liar.he claimed Dr Ellent was going to put me on hospice. He talked to my wife about it as if I was brain dead. On January 2 through 8 I was in Kingwood hospital. He claims
he is the head doctor for Cigna Health Spring, he lies so much I can not trust his.",Male
"Dr. Quadri is a great doctor but his office staff is horrible! They don't have any customer service skills, they don't return calls, send refills once pharmacy has requested refills, they put you on hold for over 10 mins, after being on hold you have to speak to 3 different staff members and have to repeat yourself 3 times just to get refills on prescriptions. They don't call to confirm doctors appt and over all it's a headache to get prescriptions even if you went to an appt just for refills.",Male
I remember meeting Dr. Qadri and feeling so much comfort. He really makes you feel at ease and helps you a lot. He is a great physician and really listens to what you have to say and makes timely recommendations. Highly recommend him!,Male
He is a very caring and helpful practitioner. Dr.Qadri makes sure that the patient is taken care of from start to finish and really is very knowledgeable. I highly recommend him! ,Male
"Not patient friendly. Not kid friendly.  I thought at least he would be good at is his job, I was wrong. I have a problem with the tooth he filled. 
Staff are incompetent as well. They messed a bill and couldn't get it fixed despite many calls and many messages. 
If you have to go, ask for Betty Qadri.",Male
I was very pleased with excellent experience at Dr. Asif M. Qadri M.D. and his all team.  Thank you so much for providing such wonderful care.,Male
I just had a screening colonoscopy and have nothing but good words for Dr. Quadri and for his staff. The facilities are beautiful and the operation is efficiently run. The entire process took only two hours. Highly recommended.,Male
Please don’t waste your time at this office. Staff is rude. Dr. Qadri diagnosed my husband with stage 4 cirrhosis. Our last appointment was later in the afternoon he seemed more worried about getting out of there than he was about his patient. When he came in the room the first thing he said was I heard you wanted to go somewhere else for another opinion. Apparently his opinion is the only one that matters. I also called to get my husbands records and was rudely told if I got his records and went somewhere else we would be dismissed from his clinic because Dr. Qadri doesn’t deal with patients that do that. The doctors arrogance is overwhelming! We were also informed he would have to take more time off work and come back to get his labs drawn a different day because the lab was closed. None of our questions were answered. We will definitely NOT be going back.,Male
Dr. Qadri is extremely knowledgeable and personable! He and his PA are excellent! He truly cares about his patients.,Male
Dr. Qadri and his PA were excellent! They were very knowledgeable and had an excellent bedside manner. I found the office to be clean and new and the staff was friendly. Great experience!,Male
Dr. Qadri is very personable if he sees me out of the office he will stop and speak. He is very caring and I like him. His staff  needs some training on how to treat patients in a professional manner. I have had to call several times in a week to get my medication called into the pharmacy and when I called to speak to his MA she was rude and acted as if I was bothering her. Maybe she is overworked but no place to have a bad attitude. I would recommend Dr. Qadri but overlook his staff lol ,Male
"I would not recommend this office to anyone.  We only saw Dr. Qadri 1 time, the rest of the visits were with the pa. After 5 visits and 1 expensive test they still would not pick a specific diagnosis.  The lab staff is the rudest staff I have ever encountered. The biggest issue I have with this office is the lab staff were talking about patients being difficult and ""a pain"" by name in front of patients in the lab waiting area.  Totaly unacceptable!",Male
I would not recommend this practice to anyone.,Male
"Please do your research before going to Dr. Qadri!  He will push expensive, unnecessary tests at you before completing basic research on your condition (like reviewing your blood work).  He is rude and reticent to explain procedures, speculatively because he's not following protocol in practicing basic diagnosis.  I would not recommend this doctor to friends or family.",Male
Excellent doctor.  He and his PA both spent plenty of time with me addressing my concerns.  They were comforting and made sure I had all questions answered before our visit was over.  Outstanding practice.,Male
Excellent across the board. Very helpful and knowledgeable. Highly recommend.,Male
"This is the MOST CARING doctor I have seen. He was a genuine help to me and referred me to another specialist once he was past his expertise. I would &amp; will definitely continue to use him,
Highly recommend him. He listened to the research I have done about my condition, &amp; was actually impressed by my research. You have to be your own advocate for your health these days. Doctors are humans, not Gods.",Male
I was lucky to have her at a difficult time.She looks &amp; is a very smart physician .I was scared of going to Oakwood coz i had heard its a busy hospital and people say that you dnt get attention from doctors. bt luckily i gt Dr qadri. She was kind enough to explain what was happening before i went into labor. I ws delivered by another senior dr but she made sure that stayed in the room during my delivery. It was good to see her smiling and encouraging. I will try to get her for my next one iA,Female
"poor communication, this doctor didn't treat me like a person, I was admitted to hospital due to preterm labour, she didn't even explained to me if there was contractions on the monitor or no, I even asked her if I can drink water she said she will ask the other doctor and never come back to let me know or even send the nurse who was also ignoring me, I been fasting for more than 4 hours which itself is a risk for premature contractions. If I am not allowed too she should at least order iv fluid",Female
"If I could give her a half a star I would. This woman debilitated me. What started with a fibroid turned into a partial hysterectomy that she could not finish because of Endometriosis. I was then sent to a specialist which I thought she was especially having 45 years experience. I can not walk longer half 1/4 of a mile, I’m suffering from chronic pelvic pain, and overall pain from dealing with all the pelvic pain which I did not have before she did surgery on me. She disabled me!! I would not recommend anyone to this woman. 3 surgeries later and I’m still in the same pain that I was in after Qadri worked on me.",Female
"Never again, waited an hour and thirty something odd minutes to be seen to be talked loudly to with the door open. What happened to patient privacy seriously? Doctor seemed to care more about her surgeries I will not be returning.",Female
She is an excellent dr. Very polite and treats patients very kindly .,Female
The wait time is pretty awful. I would like more respect for my time and things I need to do besides wait for an hour after my scheduled appointment time. ,Female
Excellent visit indeed.,Male
I was referred to Dr Qadri by my PCP in 2010 for high protein in my urine. I saw him for about 1 1/2 years when he said I no longer needed to see him. His exact words were “Your filtration is better than mine” In 2015 as a result of routine blood work my PCP informed me my GFR was at 24%. I went back to Qadri and he informed me that I needed to start insulin and stop several meds that were bad for my kidneys. I guess he has never heard of preventative medicine.,Male
"Dr. Qadri is a Doctor that does not listen. He does not like to be questioned. If you are a strong independent woman, don’t see this doctor that works one day a week!",Male
Dr Qadri has been my primary for a few years now and has been great! He’s very open to discussing all your concerns and answering your questions! His bedside manner is great and an important quality I look for in a Dr. My whole family sees him also and my husband just switched over to him to have a closer Dr.  He’s trustworthy and a wonderful dr!,Male
i had a great time at my office visit with him. i had gone in for a sick visit and i was really taken care of. they got me in right away i will definitely be referring both of these doctors-husband and wife couple.,Male
Dr. Qadri takes the time to listen and his bedside manner is impeccable. He really cares about his patients.  He is open to all questions without you feeling inferior to his knowledge. His open approach allows for great communication and honesty.,Male
Dr Qadri is great doctor  staff was wonderful  need more doctors &amp;staff like them,Male
 She was incredibly kind and treated me  with sensitivity and such a hard time in my life .

"Dr. Nadia is an excellent GYN doctor, she was so sweet and understanding to my situation. She took her time with me explaining what I needed to do, I felt so comfortable being seen by her, she understood that I was nervous and worried and she help to ease my worries. I will recommend all the women I know to her the compassion she shows is what’s needed it. Thank You! Dr. Nadia. ",Female
"Dr. Qadri is an amazing doctor. His technique is flawless, his bedside manner could not be better, he goes above and beyond in all areas. I felt very well educated about my procedure after speaking with Dr. Qadri. I have never felt so well taken care of by a doctor. ",Male
This so called physician was horrible to my father. She belittled him in front of others and I would not recommend her to my worst enemy. ,Female
Kept asking me if I had watched certain reality TV shows....that is all he did...he also showed me a picture of his cats.....didn't ask me anything about my mental health,Male
I recently went to refil a prescription but it's required I go once a month to fill it. I got an email from my insurance company that he charge $350 to check my blood pressure and write a script. Except he never even came in the room. I met with some girl that might be an intern or something. so I paid a $30 co payment and got a message from Aetna that I owe more money because it visit cost more than insurance will pay,Male
"Very irresponsible. Even if the patient ends up in the hospital, he doesnt care. ",Male
"Ridiculous very bad experience, I'm going to change my doctor. They have the worst staff. No time management they think everyone is free and they r the only ones busy in this whole world. Such stupid, ridiculous people I have ever seen.",Male
"No stars here. The wait is to long
People walk in not speaking English and go straight to the dr. My chart was first and there response was that they was in place and stepped out.  Signed in two hours before. 
Terrible!  This is my last visit here. It's always over 45 minutes.",Male
Staff is extremely incompetent and rude. I called on behalf of my grandmother and was treated so horribly. My grandmother agrees that the girls at the front desk are clueless and I will now be changing her doctor thanks to Shenaz (the most rude receptionist I have ever experienced).,Male
"This doctor's wife sits at the reception and she is the rudest receptionist I have ever met. Any time you call the office and if she ahe picks up, she does not listen to a word.. I called there today because i needed a prespcription sent over to my pharmacy because the one the doctor wrote me was not covered.. but his wife was just like ""just pay for it"" ... i mean if i could pay for all my doctor's visit or prescriptions, i wouldnt bother to have insurance in the first place.. sooo lazy n rude",Male
"My experience was so great, they welcomed us nicely and the nurse and doctors were so nice. It was my first but it was the best.  I give it 5 star . and I encourage people to go there more.",Female
"She took care of mum, the facility is great. Her husband Dr Imam is also phenomenal ",Female

"Doctor Qahwash my family and I thank you for explaining everything in great details (Pros and Cons) prior to my major back operation. This was my first operation ever and you made me feel at ease.

I appreciate your true professionalism.  I am recovering well. Thank you!",Male
Quick painless surgery has me back on my feet in no time! A year later and I am still pain free. Excellent to talk to and explain the procedures. ,Male
We seen Dr Qahwash after seeing a doc in our area and feeling  confused and unable to make an informed decision on such an important surgery. We were so happy we did.  He was thorough and patient.  He asked my husband many questions and actually listened to his answers.  He explained in terms we could understand and answered all our questions.  We walked out feeling much more confident in our ability to make a decision.  I only wish he was in our network.  I highly recommend him.  HE IS AMAZING!,Male
"My experience with Dr. Qahwash has been nothing other than excellent. I could not have asked for a better neurosurgeon to care for me. He took the time to actually listen to me, answer all my questions, and genuinely seemed concerned and truly cared about me and my condition. He did my surgery to help with my Chiari Malformation and was there every day during my hospital stay to check in on me. My recovery has been amazing. I very impressed and would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone. ",Male

"Dr. Qahwash treated me for an aneurism and I credit his knowledge and expertise in neurosurgery to  my surviving  and with  very minor residual  effects - a little double vision which is gradually improving.  I was told by many professionals that he is the very best.  I was quite anxious after my aneurism as I would have another as I had no symptoms beforehead.

The treatment my son received from Dr. Qahwash after being diagnosed with a brain tumor was exceptional.  I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a neurosurgeon.,Male
"Dr.Qahwash and his team are exceptional in their feild. I was diagnosed with a colloid cyst of the third ventricle, which was an 8mm cyst blocking my spinal fluid from draining out of my brain. Dr. Qahwash was able to use the endoscopy procedure, instead of performing a full craniotomy! Dr. Qahwash takes the time to explain and listen to your concerns to make sure you are well informed and comfortable with the procedure. I totally recommend Dr. Qahwash!",Male
"I cannot say enough about Dr. Qaiser! She saw my son for the first time at the age of 4 months due to a deep sacral dimple. Our pediatrician had us terrified, but Dr. Qaiser was quick to thoroughly explain everything to us and calm us. She thoroughly examined him and discovered that he also had a tethered spinal cord and several underlying issues. She helped us get in contact with several phenomenal specialists t help with the other concerns. At the age of 8 months she did a surgery on my son's spine to release his tethered cord. Her beside manner through the entire hospital stay was so comforting. Dr. Qaiser ended up relocating before we could finish this journey with her, but I owe so much to her in my son's medical journey. She took the time to see the entire boy, not just the issue we originally came for. She cared for us as an entire family. My son is now 22 months old and is hitting all of his motor skill milestones thanks to Dr. Qaiser's thoroughness and care for him.",Female
"The wait time is extraordinarily long. This doctor has the worst bedside manner. Rude, arrogant and sloppy. Prescribed contra indicated meds to my 14 year old son, without consent, no less. Seems to love kick backs from local dodgy labs and pharma and is generally an awful person. After asking him about an abnormal basic blood panel (CBC), he fired my son off his service. Fine by me. Avoid him if you care about your health, time and peace of mind.",Male
I have been going to dr al quaisi for a few months and so far he’s been very helpful with every medical issue . He’s very informative and caring responses.

Unfortunately I was not able to have my appointment with Dr. Aldoori. They cancelled my appointment so I saw Dr. Al Qaeda instead. I was a new patient. The doctor only gave me five minutes and did not give me enough time to tell him about all my issues. He did not even physically examine me which I found odd being a new patient. The prescriptions he wrote for me were never sent to the pharmacy. He didn't order my medical records from the previous clinic. A disgrace to the profession.,Male
"Very disapponited-with him and MERCY

Son went in was supposed to be on 96 hr hold and low and behold 2 days later was being let out - said he wasnt a harm to himself or others but came out  manic and talking non stop gibberish  -  no diagnosis   no follow   give me a f'ing break",Male

After a pleasant nurse did my ultrasound Dr Qualbani came in to examine me and speak with me. He was incredibly dismissive of my concerns. He was condescending and was clear that he didn't believe there to be any problem, ""you're just too young"" &amp; started blaming my pain PMS... I had a hysterectomy when my young self had cancer several years ago.",Male
"Went in for routine mammogram, told needed more pictures, then a biopsy. Lab report: high grade, fast growing, cancer with lymph involvement.  Went away for lumpectomy and learned there was not cancer, including test on another microscopic calcification. Told I should not have left town for treatment??? Now my daughter given exact same routine, decided to wait a bit but they harassed her horribly because she did not have biopsy.  Something fishy about this place!! Should have sued 6 yrs ago.",Female

"he takes time to listen and answer questions,very kind ,",Male
"Today was my first visit with Dr. Qalla and he was absolutely wonderful. Kind, considerate, and extremely professional. He's one of my new favorites!",Male
"He was very hands off.  Once I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes, I was given very little guidance or support.  When I brought to his attention that I was unhappy with the care at my last appointment, he stated that I must have misunderstood him because he is always caring and concerned. So it was my fault that I was upset. I found it very hard to discuss my questions or concerns with him and each appointment was short and hurried.",Male
"Dr QAMAR is the best most compassionate Doctor in Ocala. He is calm soothing and his skills are beyond compare. No one is better at saving lives and caring aboutYOU, not money! His heart is so generous and full of love. He helps so many who no one else would. I am alive because of him!",Male

"Dr Qamar saved my father's life. I am forever grateful we found him to do a procedure other doctors said could not be performed.  When previously told by several doctors that he needed both feet amputated &amp; our hope was gone, Dr Qamar helped my daddy keep his feet and walk again, going on 7 years. Besides being a caring, compassionate and thorough examining doctor, his bedside manners are the best of any doctor I have dealt with. Most definitely we will bring our daddy back to him",Male
Dr. Qamar is the most caring Dr. I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He has taken care of me when I had no insurance and I feel he has saved my life.Now that I have Medicare only he takes the same wonderful care he has always taken.

She tried to dictate my disabilities of 28 years, 2 of which are autoimmune diseases, one deadly! I'm 99% homebound, but she indicated that it's all minuscule! She never sent my Rx to the pharmacy either! STAY AWAY!",Female
Terrible. Looking for a new PCP. Every interaction with this Dr and office is a nightmare. Dr is unwilling to see elderly patient's in office who are unable to partake in telemedicine (in September) for NON COVID related issues. Dr is unwilling to refill regularly taken medications. Dr is unwilling to give referrals to specialists when asked. The only thing she seems to care about is billing for her time and making sure her office is stylish.,Female
"Dr. Qamar is very kind and knowledgeable. She takes her time to listen to your concerns and addresses all of them. The front office staff are friendly and courteous, as well.",Female
"Unhelpful - receptionist gave me the run around for a week and never provided the medical records that were requested, by the patient, or the insurance.  Requires you to pay $80 office visit just to ask a questions. When patients condition became more complicated than a follow-up appointment, Dr. Qamar did not go a check in with patient at the hospital and was adamant about no longer being the PCP.",Female
"This Doctor butchered our son during his circumcision, she cut so much skin off that our son bled for six hours and we ended up in the ER because he was bleesing so much, even the nurses there tild us that so much skin was gone that they couldn't even sew his foreskin because there was nothing left! This woman watched our son bleed for hours at her office and just kept waiting and did nothing about it, now our son has to see a urologist to see if his part will be ok, Don't bring your kids here!",Female
I trust Dr. Qamar completely.  She really knows what she's doing and it's evident that she truly cares.,Female
"He is warm, friendly, and caring.",Male
Terrible. Do not see this doctor. He sent two wrong prescriptions to the pharmacy- both could have been dangerous had I no prior knowledge of the medications. The pharmacist identified the mistake. The fact that 2/2 of the medications were incorrect (and both mistakes could have been dangerous if I trusted him and took them) makes me hesitant to trust this office.,Male
"I never had a problem with Dr.Qamar. I've seen two psychiatrists before I came to American Family Psychiatry, and I never got relief or proper care. He listens and cares. I never had him yell at me. He works very hard and very long hours. His staff is very helpful and returns my phone calls as soon as possible and answers all my questions as quickly as possible as well.",Male
"Simply put, this man should seriously not have a license. The best (and only job) for Dr. Qamar would be in an office cubicle interacting with absolutely no one with zero responsibility over another person's necessary medications. This office is an absolute disgrace.",Male
"Inconsiderate to patients, rude, slow, and completely unhelpful in managing medications. I will wait in the waiting room for around a half hour each time, but then spend less than 3 minutes with Dr. Qamar. He double checks to make sure he has the right medications and pharmacy listed for you and then hits send. He kept prescribing me a medication that I had overdosed on even after speaking with the doctor that dealt with my overdose and constant reminders from me to stop prescribing those medications. Dr. Qamar has no care, concern, or consideration for his patients. This office is simply a vehicle for getting people their medications--a dangerous responsibility to treat so carelessly. They aren't flexible nor do they prioritize patient needs. There have been times where I have made it clear to Dr. Qamar and others that I absolutely need immediate access to my medication--each time they have made it difficult for me. Medication and treatment is a right--one Dr. Qamar hardly recognizes",Male
"To the comment above, he has raised his voice to me once during the 5 years he had treated me. He is still my psychiatrist and at first I just wanted to leave. But I realized that he just cared for my well-being and oversees not only is private practice in 2 locations, but Pennhighland's Hospital Inpatient Unit. I would even hear him on the phone talking rather loud towards other doctors and colleagues. I think it is funny because he is doing his job. Maybe being from Pakistan has something to do with it? Like that is just how he talks, and they may have those tempers. Who cares? If he was a problem, he would not have his practice. Believe that. He is a good psychiatrist so don't listen to one silly comment about a tantrum, especially if your not his patient.",Male
"Had 1 conversion with this doctor as a fellow professional and he went into a temper tantrum and started yelling uncontrollably. I expect more from a psychiatric doctor than this unprofessional, childish behavior.",Male
Dr. Qamar takes care of my cancer and takes her time.  She is very thorough although she doesn't get personal.,Female
One of the most compassionate doctors. She knows her stuff and makes sure she takes care of you. She does beyond what she needs to by checking on you and making sure everything is being done to cure you. You can always trust her decisions. ,Female
Dr Qamar is a very caring and tenuous doctor. I have had her four years now and I am thankful that I found her. If she is ever late for the appointment she gives you the same amount of time that you need very qualified doctor.,Female
"Dr. Qamar listens when other doctors make you feel dumb or as if you are lying about your symptoms. I am only 38 years old with CHF. Because he listened, they were able to treat me for the very thing they were saying wad all in my head or normal.",Male
"Seen within 5 minutes of appointment time. All of my questions, concerns and pain were addressed immediately. She is one of the best and very competent.",Female
Down to earth easy to talk to,Female
"i was a little nervous after dr Patrick retired, because that meant finding a new dr.  so I signed up with
dr qamar and let me tell you she is the most kindest sincerest dr ive ever had.  She listen to all of my concerns and addresses them accordingly.  if all dr's were like her the medical profession would be outstanding",Female
"I had cataract surgery on both eyes in 2014 and the experience was absolutely positive. I found Dr. Qamar to be very approachable, extremely competent, professional and very organized. The surgeries were done on separate days, scheduled about 2 weeks apart, and each one lasted only about 10 minutes.  He and his surgical staff were like a well-oiled machine. I was so impressed at how organized and efficient they all were. The follow-up care was top notch, too. If you go to his Scottsdale office be aware that the surgery will be performed at his Mesa office, at least that was the case when my surgery was performed. Despite that inconvenience, if I had to do it all over again I still would go to him for cataract removal.  I highly recommend Dr. Qamar and have nothing but high praise for him and his staff.",Male
"Dr. Qamar performed cataract surgery with toric lens implants in both of my eyes in late 2016. Throughout my appointments, he and his staff were friendly, kind, professional, competent and well organized. I experienced no problems before, during or after my surgeries, and I've been pleased with the results. Medicare paid for the cataract surgery, but I had to pay for the toric lenses (which correct astigmatism), so I especially appreciated Dr. Qamar's reasonable charges. I recommend him highly.",Male
Wonderful,Female
"Dr Qamar is awesome, I can not give her 10 stars otherwise I would.I definitely recommend her.",Female
I wish there could b a option for 0 star dr qamar n her staff r really unprofessional...  staff was really rude she slamed the window on me when i walked out bcoz my insurance was not working with her dr came out to find out bcoz there were no patients except me n still she wa sooo rude that if i wanna see her i have to paybout of pocket so much attitude with no patients at all in her clinic... worst dr n staff i have ever seen... she doesnt care abt sick patient i think she only took oath to eat money... she didnt even consider that we share same religion n cultural value... really disaapointed me...,Female
My husband has been a patient for over 4 years. He loves her! My husband has had many medical issues and Dr. Qamar is very excellent.,Female
I liked her intelligence and bed side manner.,Female
Dr Qamar is an excellent doctor.  She takes very good care of her patients.  She remembers every detail of your visit when she's putting in her notes.  She had helped me with so many things and I really appreciate that.,Female
Wonderful doctor! My father and I both are patients. ,Female
Great with her patients. Never gives up. Treats you like family. Staff is amazing.,Female
"Dr. Qamar is the absolute best. She is courteous, professional and intelligent. She is always interested in you and listens to all your concerns. I was very apprehensive about seeking treatment but after meeting Dr. Qamar and the Wound Care staff, I was confident in their abilities. After some months of seeking treatment from Dr. Qamar and the Wound Care staff, I am almost completely healed. The office staff is very efficient and professional. They are always accommodating to my needs. ",Female
Iv been going to DR. Qamar for a few years now and I have never had a bad visit with her. She’s always given me the time to tell her my complains and concerns. I enjoy her as well as her staff. It’s a small office which is one reason I enjoy it. I’ve gotten a lot of family and friends to go there!!!! ,Female
"Wil ask you questions, then not listen the answer before she interrupts you. Will even look up her face is in her laptop. I never write reviews but I felt the need to warn people. This doctor is a joke.I see why it was so easy to get an appointment so fast.",Female
Most unpleasant experience I have ever had with doctor.  Unprofessional and rude.  ,Female
Orders a sleep apnea test when I know I didn't have symptoms. Cost several hundred dollars out of pocket.  Not very engaging. Follows a computer aided flow chart. ,Male
"I found that he lacks an understanding of and patience with the most rudimentary of mental health issues-anxiety. Getting my records from my previous doctor has been nightmarish. I've been paying for an office visit each time I needed my Rx filled; I decided to get a new diagnosis with Dr. Qamer. When he said I had to now see a psychologist before getting my Rx, I became upset but never yelled or cursed. He curtly ended our session by pushing his chair back and standing up. Behavior Doc? Pish.",Male
Had a problem with back and he got me in quickly to be seen.  He listens and genuinely cares about his patients and would highly recommend him to anyone seeking treatment for spine issues.,Male

I’d give him 10stars if I could! Great Dr.!",Male
I just love and adore Dr. Q.  He and his team have been great to me during this trying time with my back.  They have been quick to return my phone calls and take care of my needs.  His bedside manner is excellent.  He is genuinely concerned about my heath.  He takes the time at my appt to talk about what my options are.  I am so happy he is here in Columbia.,Male
Follow up for back injury. The original doctor I saw retired and Dr  Q was recommended.,Male
"Dr Q is a quiet, humble man but an outstanding professional! When I had given up after seeing many specialists, he gave me my first glance of hope.",Male
He is one of the most straight up- tell it like it is doctors I’ve ever met— yet he has compassion and empathy for his patients! Best choice ever when choosing a specialist!,Male
"Dr.Q and his staff are so kind hearted &amp; understanding. They know how to help you,want to help you throughout your care with them. Very knowledgeable and go beyond the minimum. The staff are very respectful and care about your needs. I greatly recommend Dr. Q for all your bone &amp; joints needs. I travel the distance to see Dr Q and his staff because of the care and trust I received from them and I won't settle for anyone else. Please consider them I'm sure you won't be disappointed !",Male
I could not be more pleased with my surgery and Dr. Qamirani. He takes his time and explains everything very well. He has been honest and realistic about my diagnosis. He is caring and concerned. Has followed up with me very closely and often since my surgery. I would highly recommend him to anyone.,Male
Very attentive to our needs and quick to act with surgery during the coronavirus pandemic.  Thankful for successful surgery and looking forward to continued aftercare under him.,Male
"I’ve seen Dr Q with two different things and he has been very much on top of it.  I know he’s getting tired of seeing all my arthritis but the two shots he did in shoulders has been wonderful
So
Far and shot in back has seemed to have helped some too.",Male
Good experience.  Knowledgeable and made me feel at ease with my questions.,Male
The best all around Medical professional I’ve ever dealt with.  He has a unique ability to combine  a vast knowledge base with an excellent bedside manner.  A true professional,Male

I have complete confidence in Dr.Q i would recommend him to anyone needing back surgery....ive had a lot of surgies through the years and wasnt always happy with the doctors bed side manner but i felt so at home with Dr.Q.
I ask a lot of questions and he answered all of them in a way i could understand he spent plenty of time with me.
I would highly recommend Dr.Q im looking forward to my spine surgery and getting back to my old self real soon.
Thank you so much Dr.Q im so happy i came to see for my back trouble.",Male
He is the best Dr. Dr Q. has the best bedside manner and is extremely smart. If he doesn’t know the answer he will find the answer. He is all about getting you out of pain and getting you back to your life. I would not trust my back to another Dr unless he recommends further treatment that he doesn’t do.,Male
Dr Q did a great job...I have healed well and am doing great,Male

Very quick and to the point!!,Male
Dr Quamarini is the best Dr. I have been to in years. He did my neck c5 through c7 surgery. His main priority is to answer all of my questions &amp; to make me feel as comfortable as possible.  He answered all of my questions &amp; concerns. He is very polite &amp; respectful. I have recommended him to all of my friends &amp; will continue to do so. His staff is very polite &amp; informative as well. If you have any questions or concerns about sort or long term disability i urge you to ask for Daphne. She is a life saver.,Male

Dr. Qamruddin was so thourough at my visit.  She explained everything really well and made me feel comfortable.  ,Female
"Dr. Qamruzzaman is an outstanding  oncologist . He is enthusiastic about sharing information and implementing up-to-date cancer treatment. His diagnosis and procedures have been absolutely correct.

Excellent doctor.  Very caring and up to date.  Highly recommend.,Male
"Dr Q is an excellent Oncologist. However his recent merge with Dr. Kahn, left Canton Patients more confused as if getting diagnosed with cancer &amp; seeing multiple specialists isnt enuf?Arlene who answers the phone at Dr Kahn's Office shows no compassion and makes us feel as if we're bothering her.  I dread calling there &amp; only do so as a last resort. She's rude,  crabby &amp; shows no compassion. So no I wouldn't refer this office to an enemy. ",Male
"Bad, inexperienced, greedy, only wants to talk about insurance before discussing treatment, does not follow beaumont hospital rules!!!! How did he ever get licensed???? Left his care real quick !!!!! Staff at his clinic is rude and incompetant. Left me standing at the window for about 8 minutes while they all discussed what they should order for lunch. Everyone involved is sooooo very unprofessional ! Not good when youre dealing with cancer.",Male
"If you have a diagnosis of cancer, don't go to this office. This office is dark and depressing and the office staff doesn't care.  The doctors I believe are all about the money and install the port, pump the chemo treatments.  If you call the office to speak or have the doctor call you back because you are experiencing new or more chronic symptoms, it'll be to late if you hear from them. Don't count on them caring about or take time to be concerned for their patients. Stay clear of here.",Male
"I am a current  patient  with  Dr. Nicholas Qandah and I have received excellent  care  from him. He is compassionate ,kind and he  explains my  medical condition  so as I can  understand it. I thank you, thank you so much Dr. Nicholas Qandah for being so compassionate and  understanding. May God Bless you and  all  your staff.",Male
"My father went to Sparrow in Lansing, MI where he needed immediate surgery.  Apparently his condition was too serious for Qandeel to operate even after telling us he would operate, so with a condition that required immediate surgery, he waited for over 6 hours to finally be transferred to another hospital an hour away.  He passed upon arriving at the other hospital.",Male
"I feel very comfortable and cared for with him. He is kind and throrough. I have a full medical history and he is  concderned about it.

"Dr. Qannan was very attentive, courteous and willing to spend time with me.  He does not push drugs as solutions but looks at life style and other changes which can be used to accomplish results.  Overall a very excellent staff, short wait time and a very professional caring feel with the doctor and his staff.",Male
"It's rare to find a pleasant, caring,  compassionate, and personable physician. I adore Dr. Qaqish. He has always answered questions. Treated me with respect and had me leaving his office feeling like he genuinely cares about my health and well being. Thank you Dr. Qaqish and all of your support staff! You go above and beyond my expectations!",Male
"My daughter was deadly ill and Dr Qaqish stepped in. He was on top of it- came by 4 times in one day to see how things were developing. I was stressed out and he assured me that he would chase the situation all night even when he was not on call. His concern, knowledge, honesty, determination and care were exemplary. He has all my respect!",Male
"He is the best doctor. I tried to switch to other doctors due to he moves his office to Newburgh and it is far for me; however, I always returned because I did not find a better doctor than him. Really recommended ",Male

Dr Qarni is knowledgeable and understanding of all my issues. I can usually get in quik (2-3 days) if I need to. I've been with him for several years now. I am very satisfied with the service I get,Male
"My husband, chdren and I go see Doctor Qarni and have since 2001.  My parents, brother and his family, my husbands Mom, &amp; Grandparents all go see him.  When you call the office I say who I am and the receptionist knows all about us without pulling a chart. You are actually a person not just a number or a paycheck for them.  They truly care for their patients.  Not to mention my eldest child had MRSA as a child &amp; Dr. Qarni got on the phone with his friend at the CDC and they made her better.",Male
"I love Dr. ""Q""...he and Dr. Waseem saved my life...I cried when I changed jobs and had Kaiser doctors, but now I have CIGNA and can go back to him...",Male
"Dr . Qasabian is very smart ,experienced and careful MD. I strongly recommend him to
everybody who needs a treatment for cancer. I.Tregub",Male
Dr. Qasaymeh’s been my neurologist for over a decade. Highly recommend. Thorough and cares about his patients. ,Male
I went to this doctor scared for my daughter’s health and he was so dismissive and had no empathy or compassion for our pain and concern. He misdiagnosed my daughter and literally spent 3 minutes with us in the room. He is egotistical and doesn’t show like he cares about his patients. I felt so sad for my daughter. I would not recommend this doctor. He is terrible and I gave him a second chance and he still treated us the same way.,Male
"Awful experience and am not one to write negative review, but I do not want another child to suffer or receive negligent treatment the way my daughter did. Also, no family or parents deserve to be threatened to be kicked out when suffering solely for asking about side effects of medication.  This is what happened to us, and due to Dr. Q not taking our situation seriously enough, my daughter suffered. He did not want to do do genetic testing or an MRI, and only wanted to keep layering medication. She had seizures that got worse as more meds were prescribed. When I called the emergency line, he told us that he is the only doctor who calls back and sometimes is not able to. Unacceptable! I ended up having to call Children's and bring her in for hospitalization.  Luckily, Children's did testing and pushed for her to go to Cleveland Clinic where it was found that she had cortical focal dysplasia. She ended up needing surgery. Thank goodness she is doing much better now. Total waste of time.",Male
"Horrible experience all around. Lacked compassion, not thorough, unavailable, scheduling tests was not timely if at all",Male
"Dr Q took his time, was thorough in his questioning and exams, and was very reassuring in his approach. He frequently returned phone calls independently and never made me feel rushed or that I had bothered him.
He was persistent in his testing and never once went overboard in ordering anything unnecessary.
I am forever grateful!

Phone operators could use some ""polishing"" as there are two young ladies there who are often abrupt/abrasive...but otherwise, staff was courteous and professional!",Male
Thank you Dr.Qasaymeh for every thing. ,Male
The best Doctor ever. He is real human being . Thank you for what you have done!!!,Male
DR. Q has quite possibly saved my son's life by diagnosing him with a rare congenital disorder...Thank you DR.Q you are amazing.,Male
"Very knowledgeable,  compassionate and professional ",Male
Worst experience I have ever had with a physician.  He was in and out in under five minutes; asked very few questions about symptoms; gave a very brief course of action. This was my daughters fourth significant concussion and he showed no real interest. Very dismissive.,Male
"Dr. Qasba has taken excellent care of our daughter recently at the Suburban Hospital. She rounded twice daily and took her time during the rounds to explain and answer our questions patiently. She guided the multidisciplinary care of our daughter perfectly, communicated with all involved specialists very timely, and she was available whenever needed. She is an excellent hospitalist and I very strongly recommend her.",Female
"She is, by far THE worse doctor I have ever encountered. I agree with other review, if you have her as Dr at Suburban hospital ask for a different Dr right away. She gave my husband a drug and didn’t know side effects. He was hallucinating and could barely speak, he couldn’t walk either. Her bedside manner was non existent. She sent him for a CT that he didn’t need before I arrived at the hospital and insisted he needed an MRI and argued with me because I told her he just had one. RUN",Female
"Honestly the worst doctor I have ever seen. Didn't care about her patients, horrible bedside manner and did not care about long term patient quality of life. Other providers she spoke to were shocked at her unprofessionalism, with one of my doctors noting ""Dr Qasba was unable to treat patient in even the simplest manner."" If you or a family member is assigned Dr Qasba, ask for someone else immediately. She did not listen to patient or family and did more harm than good.",Female
"Dr. Qasba is my both daughter's pediatrician x more than 10 years. She is SUPER knowledgeable,  caring, and kind doctor who really cares about every single concerns that we have. The wait time is long sometimes but it really worth to wait. We feel so blessed to have her.",Female
"Maybe he wasn't having a good day.  Seemed very rushed.  I was partially awake during colonoscopy procedure.  For some reason he began pushing and kneading my stomach causing pain that I hadn't expected and didn't appreciate.  I didn't receive an explanation, after the procedure.  ",Male
"I have been having routine colonoscopies every five years since I was 35. I was 50 when Dr. Qaseem performed my colonoscopy and, as with the other procedures, polyps were found and removed. After the colonoscopy he asked me if my diet was high in fat, and it was, so I told him yes. He told me to change my diet to low fat and eat more fiber. Well, I took his advice and did what he recommended and my last colonoscopy ( a week ago) did not find polyps! He is the only Dr. who helped me.",Male
Dr Qasem is very good. He is intelligent and listens to his patients. I believe he is providing the best care that he can. His staff on the other hand is absolutely horrible. Very rude and disrespectful. They are not helpful at all. I would not refer to him due to his inconsiderate staff. ,Male
"Dr. Qasem literally saved my life. He saw my xrays from my emergency room visit because they referred me to him, &amp; had his nurse call me &amp; set up an appt. By the time I left his office I already had my appt. for the bone marrow test. This was so very important because we needed to know if the cancer had gone to the bone. Thankfully it hadn't. My original appt. for the test was 7 weeks out. So glad we didn't have to wait. It may have been too late. Thank you again, Dr. Qasem.",Male

"Rule No. 1: NEVER YELL AT YOUR PATIENTS. Dr. Raab suggested a cream that he stores with him at his office. I simply told him that I would rather have this medication picked up at my pharmacy because my insurance would pay for it. The minute he heard that, he started yelling that he will not waste his time in prior authorization if the pharmacy requests one.

"This ""doctor"" is riddiculus. He made my ACL surgery but some time after something started to be wrong with my knee. When I showed him that my knee is completely unstable and weak he just said that he doesn't want to see me for next 6 months. Then another doctor found some post surgery problems because the first surgery wasn't made like it should be. Not recommended at all!",Male
Dr. Raab replaced my left knee on 3/14 2016 after my initial sports meniscus tear in 1978. The Visionare system that he used and his expertise have allowed me to continue to play softball and all of the other sports that.I enjoy. Dr Raab is the best !,Male
"I've been a patient of Dr. Raab's off and on for the past 30+ years.  I say off and on, because I only have occasion to see him when my knees ""act up"" or I have another physical issue.  Today it was my shoulder.  I can't say enough great things about him.  He's personable, humorous, kind, caring, knowledgeable, and has an excellent bedside manner.  In addition, I can't tell you how many people I know who are patients of his and rave about him.  Quite simply, he's the best.",Male
"I endured knee pain for almost 10 years, the last 5 with an unloading brace that started with occasional use then became an every-day need. Dr. Raab had told me I would let him know when it was time. When I decided to go for the replacement he explained exactly what would happen, the day of surgery was very smooth, and they had me up and walking on the new knee within a few hours (probably not the norm). Recovery was as expected, the physical therapist kept pushing and I was walking somewhat nor",Male
I've used Dr. Raab 2 times in 17 years for different knee injuries (ACL and Meniscus).  He did such an amazing job the first time that I knew to use him the second time for a different knee injury.  Amazing work both times!!!  I would highly recommend him!,Male
Did an excellent job replacing both of my Knees.  Highly Recommend Dr. Raab and his support staff.,Male
"Met Dr. Raab 26 years ago. we were both young then. He performed ACL surgery on me and it went extremely well. After 36 years as a UPS driver, I needed a knee replacement. wife asked me if I was going to get a 2nd opinion.told her no because I trust him absolutely. Knee replacement also went very well. He's a real stickler about germs and that made me feel confident there would not be any complications. office visits used to run behind quite a bit but the last few years are much better.Great guy",Male
"Dr. Raab is an excellent orthopedic surgeon. He has done both of my knees and both surgeries were successful with no complications afterwards.

"The doctor and nurse practitioner are great, but there's a few things that aren't so great about the office itself. The wait time is at least 45 minutes or more. There have diffinitly been times where other patients come in after me and go in before me. Good luck trying to get a hold of your physician on the phone. When you do get someone on the phone you're questioned like crazy (understandable for some situations) and almost feels like they're trying to talk you out of your concerns before even talking to your physician. Have had to call the office (and wait for a call back) to receive my results for labs or radiology reports because otherwise I wouldn't hear anything.",Male
We have been going to Dr. Raab for over 22 years and find him to be an excellent doctor.,Male

It takes a lot of trust to be able to have someone replace both knees at once, and I truly feel I placed that trust in the perfect team. I have had, unbelievable support, encouragement and STELLAR care from Dr. Raab, Sierra, Kirby and the nurses. They really LISTENED to my concerns, answered every question and supported my decisions with knowledge and experience. I HIGHLY recommend Dr.,Raab and his team for your ortho needs. In my opinion,  I could have not chosen better!!!",Male

"I had a knee replacement in 2015.  After a full year of being told that I just needed to wait because I was still in much pain and was put in a knee brace to walk, I looked for another doctor.  I finally found Dr. Raab.  He took time to listen to me and explained that the components used in my knee weren't right for me so we discussed a revision.  He did that in 2017.  I could tell a major difference right away.  Not only that, but after surgery, I had to be checked for blood clots due to unexplained calf pain.  I seen Dr Raab in the office and then he sent me to the ER.  He even came to check on me personally late that night.  He was much more than just a good doctor.  I am glad to say that I am still doing very well and anyone needing help with knee pain should definitely consider no other doctor except Dr. Raab.",Male
"I had two co-workers used Dr Rabb for knee replacement surgery with tremendous success.  I decided he was my Dr for hip replacement surgery.  His health grades were very high.  

The entire staff is very friendly and personable, more importantly they want you to have a lifetime of success after surgery.  I had to lose 24 lbs and get my BMI under 40.  I got there and recently had surgery.  The good part, I plan to lose another 12-15 lbs AND keep it all off.  I just wish they would open a satellite  Office in Murfreesboro for any future needs I might have.......",Male

This is the best working team and practice I’ve encountered in many years. Time is precious and they stick to their schedule on point. Everything from appt times to leaving a message and receiving a call back is spot on!! I have seen 3 different Doctors in this group and all have been superb!,Male
"I had a very bad experience with Gregory Raab.  He did a total knee replacement on me and no doubt his technic Is good because my knee is doing great.  The problem is his post opp pain control.  He controls pain with loratab which is not much stronger than over the counter pain meds. My pain lasted about 10 hours and it was out of control, it wasn't just pain it was torture.  I can't understand this when he gave me a prescription to go home with 100 oxycodone 10 mg.  I took only 3 for my pain.",Male
"After having multiple surgeries performed on both my knees by other surgeons (all being somewhat traumatic), I was to the point of just giving up. I made an appt. with Dr. Raab as a third opinion to appease the insurance company. After an almost hour long visit, my wife and I are both convinced he is an absolute God sent. He examined the concern, mapped out a plan, and explained everything in a way we could easily understand. We left with a sense of relief and my wife almost in tears of joy. ",Male
"Dr. Raab was extremely straight forward and easy to talk to. He answered every question and provide me with answers I could understand and options that were the best fit for my situation. His entire staff from start to finish were wonderful to work with. I know everyone says it but I can't believe I waited so long to have my knee replaced. I will be visiting him again should my other knee need to be replaced in the future. 
Thank you Dr. Raab and team!!",Male

He explains the options and takes the time to answer any questions that you have. The staff is very professional, very knowledgeable and friendly. The PA Scott Cordell was very helpful and professional he answered all questions and you didn't feel rushed. Over all a Great experience.",Male
I had Dr. Raab as my doctor for Rotator Cuff surgery. I had excellent care by his staff and with him. He is an excellent surgeon and I had no complications and he explained the entire procedure with me. I did very well with my physical therapy that he recommended.

"Dr. Raab surgically repaired my shoulder after I dislocated it and tore my rotator cuff in 2 places. He is very kind, compassionate, and takes the time to explain diagnosis and treatment plan. He always took the time to answer my questions and concerns. I was very apprehensive at first, he said it wouldn't be easy, but he told me what to expect, encouraged me to follow his plan of care, and everything went exactly as he said it would go! I healed perfectly and am very happy with my better- than- ever shoulder! So glad for Doctors like him! Thanks Dr. Raab! You are awesome!",Male

My recovery was very smooth and the care I received from Dr. Raab was first rate!   He directed by PT all during the recovery process and I truly believe that made all the difference in the world in how fast I was able to bounce back.  I will happily return to him for any future issues and will happily recommend him to others.",Male
"I tripped and fell on my right knee, tearing the quadriceps tendon from the kneecap, requiring reattachment by Dr. Raab.  Three years later it happened again on my left knee.

I cannot imagine better results.",Male

Dr. Raab is very personable and a great surgeon.   It took a plate and 11 pins to fix my ankle.  It took 61/2 months for full recovery.  I followed his directions.  I went to 13 therapy sections.  I worked and exercised as instructed.   I'm 73 years old and walk normally today.,Male
Highly would recommend Dr. Raab. Excellent wrist surgeon. Patience with explaining steps and procedures. Excellent staff.,Male
"I was recommended by a coworker after a successful knee surgery and I have since done the same.  Unlike every other doctor I've ever been to, he doesn't seem like he's in a hurry to get out the door.  He did not interrupt me when I spoke and he spoke slowly and carefully to me.  He had a kind bed-side manner rare in a doctor.  Would recommend.",Male
Dr Raab was superb in repairing a very bad tearing of my rotator cuff. After my consultation with him where he told me my options and what would probably the outcome for each one surgery was the best if I wanted to hopefully get close to full usage again.  He said it was one of his top 10 worse tears and told me it would take a good 6 months of recovery.  Well it's been 7 months and he was right!  I'm doing very well and doing things never thought u would ever be able to do again!  Great surgeon,Male
Very disappointed in this surgeon.  I had rotator cuff surgery that was unsuccessful.   Had to go to another surgeon and had another surgery to correct the problem caused by this surgeon.  I do not recommend him.,Male
Dr. Raab did an excellent job of finding the problem with my knee (torn meniscus) and had me in surgery 1 week later. The whole procedure went well and  no real pain or discomfort was experienced. I was on crutches for 2 days then back to a modified normal life. I was in physical therapy for 3 sessions  and now I am outside walking again with no pain! I would recommend Dr. Raab who is very caring and a good listener to all your questions and concerns. Everyone I came in contact with was great.,Male
Very caring! Gives you options for fixing problems and lets you decide what is best for you.,Male
Excellent doctor.  Repaired spiral fibula break.  Surgery and recovery went just as he explained.  Terrific bedside manner.  ,Male
"Dr. Raab showed kindness and  much care in explaining what was going on with my wrist.  He laid out my options, explaining in-depth, each one. He listened very attentively as I explained my fear of shots. Then he let me know exactly what to expect in choosing the cortisone shot. Dr. Raab allowed me to think about my choice by leaving me alone to make my decision. Upon administering the shot he was so very precise, patient, and actually talked me through the process, which I was so appreciative.",Male
I could not have asked for better care for a knee injury.  The office staff were professional and friendly.  Dr. Raab knew what the problem was and how to correct the issues even before it was confirmed by an MRI.  He anticipated my concerns and explained the procedure and recuperation in an understandable and caring manner both pre and post surgery.,Male
"He repaired and old injury in my wrist. I went in for surgery and when I woke up I felt immediately better, I was even able to work the rest of the day! I never needed any pain medicine at all.

therapy helped tremendously. Thanks again Dr Raab and  thank you also Kassandra &amp; Morgan for your help &amp; kindness.",Male
"No words can articulate the professionalism and concern expressed by Dr. Raab, Dr. Haber, and the entire staff as I experienced excruciating back pain.  From the time I arrived ( a wheelchair was needed since I couldn’t walk) until the time I had to get back into the car to leave, everyone seemed to be on a personal mission to make me as comfortable as possible.  By everyone, I am including the reception area, billing, scheduling, PT, and anyone else employed by this practice. EVERYONE wanted me to have pain relief. 

The lengths that every single team member went through to make me as comfortable as possible  are above and beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. Knowing that people genuinely care is as much a part of the healing process as the treatment itself.  I would recommend this team without the slightest bit of hesitation!",Male

"Dr. Raab is truly the type of individual and physician that I seek.  Caring and empathetic, patient and compassionate.  An excellent communicator.  I recently visited Dr. Raab regarding chronic back pain and he patiently and reviewed my results with me explaining my condition in terms that resonated with me and then developed a treatment plan that has provided me with relief.  A surgeon yes, but never felt that I was meeting with a surgeon.  The treatment plan did not involve surgery.",Male

Dr. Raabe did surgery on my husband over 8 years ago.  We have been to see him several times since then.  Our last couple of visits  were like to hurry up and get us out of there.  In the past he always seemed concerned and would ask questions but that changed.  We had an appointment 1/28/21 .  We were put in the room a little after 2:00 and were still in there at 2:35 and no nurse ever came back in and said the Dr. would be with us shortly no communication so we left.  Our time is valuable too and common courtesy makes all the difference in the world.  When we left one of the girls said can we help you and I told her we had been in that room over 30 minutes and we were leaving and she said oh sorry.   Azalea has always been one of our favorite  places but yesterday was not a good experience.,Male

"I highly recommend Dr. Raacke.  She is extremely knowledgeable, experienced and has a great bedside manner. ",Female
Dr Raacke expresses interest in her patients and cares about their well being,Female
"After being in Mt Sinai Hospitals ER for over a day. I was taken to observation after having an endoscopy in the afternoon of the second day. I met Dr Raacke while she was making her rounds the next morning with physicians asst. She asked a few surface questions then left. After we contacted my primary care physician, who was concerned that i would be released from the hospital without a GI dr to exam me. Dr Raacke returned and showed alil more interest in my state of health.",Female
"Dr Raad is highly knowledgeable, professional and compassionate doctor .",Male
If only Dr. Raad's arrogance matched his competence this negative review would be unnecessary. His conduct on an ICU unit is characterized by argumentativeness and disrespect of? patients and their families. ,Male
Excellent !!,Male
Professional. Explains things thoroughly. Overall concern for the patients wellbeing. ,Male
"After 2 minutes of talking to me Raad decided that I have been misdiagnosed for 15 years by multiple specialists. Raad tried to force a bipolar diagnosis because I described normal mood changes, ""some days I am happier than others"". I'm not exaggerating. He didn't consult the DSM-5, &amp; interrupted me when I clarified that I've never experienced mania in my life, &amp; I've never been diagnosed bipolar in 15 years of psych exams. Once I rejected his incorrect diagnosis, Raad REFUSED to talk about the actual reason for my visit. Instead he gave me a sample of expensive blood pressure meds. According to Propublica, Raad accepted almost $7000 from drug companies in 2018.
ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AS A PATIENT! Dr. Raad will talk over you, and make diagnoses he quite frankly doesn't appear qualified to make.
The therapist who referred me to Raad was extremely apologetic that Raad not only wasted my time, but attempted to deceive and manipulate me to accept a diagnosis he seemed to make on impulse.",Male
"Dr Raad's demeanor can be abrasive. His arrogance became apparent when he reached beyond his scope and argued with specialist's recommendations. Another doctor warned me that he can be difficult; I can handle that, but the pettiness he demonstrated came to the point of interfering with my treatment plan. ",Male
"Dr Raad has an extremely presumptuous demeanor.  He comes across initially as good intentioned, and he may be, but the way he speaks to patients and conducts himself when forming a treatment plan is belittling and insulting. ",Male
"I have been with Dr.Radd  for several  years but because he went to the new program  but i was seening another doctor in the office. I had emergency that I really needed to see a doctor and it was a private matter to me i practically beg the lady to let me come in no appoinments available I'm sorry.  Doctor Radd is a excellent doctor but his staff people have no compassion you can be about dead but they dont care 
just because you went to the Top doesnt mean you cant fall down to the bottom.",Male
He is very knowlegable with all types of illnesses and I like when he gives you a shot to jump start the process of healing if needed instead of just prescribing pills. I trust him and his decisions around my care.,Male
"Oct 2015, Dr Raad office politics changed. In other words, unless U'PAY' to see Dr Raad, $1600.00, for the new office politics, U were to see the new Dr brought in. Only, the one in there now makes the 3rd Dr in that position.
Jan 26,2016 called to make an app to see Dr. Im one of the less fortunate &amp; can't pay $1600. The office staff is VERY rude. I had to call a total of 5x's. Reason..they knew who I was and wasn't on Raads plan.ETERNAL HOLD 34m 7sec.Brenda-Cindy.

He remembers everything about his patients. He's always following up with me to make sure I'm feeling. What I love most is how compassionate he is towards me &amp; will answer a countless amount of questions. I definitely recommend seeing Dr Raad.",Male
"My experience was exceptional. I had been to two other specialists, who failed to diagnose me. On the urging of a family member, I went to see Dr. Raad. He asked questions, did tests, and examined me far more carefully and thoroughly than any other doctor I had been to. I think he is very smart and experienced.",Male
He is the worst doctor I’ve ever seen. Waste of my time. I went in concerned about a sore throat with lump near my tonsil. He didn’t care to listen to what I had to say and told me he didn’t know. When I still expressed concern he somewhat yelled at me and told me to just see a specialist/ENT if I was so worried. ENT takes a month to get an appointment.,Male

"Hidden cost on consultation not asked for or required.  Was given very basic general advice that one can google and charged under special consultation that the front desk could not provide information on what the charge was for.

 I have been very pleased with the manner in which Dr. Raasch has addressed my medical conditions.  She is very open and direct and she has been very accommodating.  She listens and is empathetic.  She explains her plans and the reasons for her actions.  At every consultation she provides a hand written list of observations and directions. She is thorough and never makes me feel rushed  For my personality I could not have a better caregiver.,Female

When we showed up the girl at the desk Maria just simply said that they don't have that date available nor the time. She just stared at her computer without apologizing or offering a solution.  I asked her ""why would we show up on a date and time that does not even exist in your schedule"" I demanded to speak to the doctor or manager and she told me to calm down and went to talk to the doctor.

Despite being so young, Dr. Rab spoke to me like I was an adult, explaining the entire procedure so that I could understand it. 

I am now 47 years old and, thanks to him, I walk almost normally and have had a successful career giving back to my community.

"22 years ago, Dr. Rab performed corrective surgery on my 2 year old son's feet. My son was born with bilateral clubfoot, a more severe case.

I just had an eye peel with Dr. Rabady and 2 cataract surgeries with Dr. Zieker both went extremely well and was all done within 4 weeks. I would highly recommend this practice they are highly professional and great to deal with.,Male
"Simply put he saved my eyesight. Out of nowhere, appeared distorted vision. After 10 days, made an appointment to check it out. The practice got me in immediately and after the first look, referred me to Dr Rabday as had concerns. The next day, his examination revealed a macular hole. Never heard of such a diagnosis. He immediately calmed me by explaining what it was and what could be done to correct. It was important to act and surgery was scheduled within a week. He took concerned calls from my husband and took all the time we needed to understand all this diagnosis entailed. The surgery was a success and am forever grateful for his wonderful, professional demeanor and the necessary skills. It was the best decision to put my care in his hands.",Male
"Life-saver !!!!
He gave me my life back. I was literally living in the dark . My diabetic retinopathy was mismanaged and getting worse . Dr Rabady rescued my Vison. He did a complex emergency surgery repair and I CAN SEE MY KIDS AGAIN. I haven't been able to since the last TWO years.

THANK YOU. Dr Rabady and all the team at OCCR!

Very compassionate  yet professional and very prompt. 

I just wish I saw him earlier!!",Male
"I had a retinal vein occlusion in my right eye. I saw 3 dif. docs. at Op. Consultants.. the 3rd being Dr. Rabady. One of his recommendations was the opposite of one given by one of his associates, and when I brought this up, he addressed it by insisting that the DIAGNOSIS was the same. Though true, this didn't negate the fact that the RECOMMENDATIONS based on this diagnosis were opposites. Still, I trusted him and saw him a 2nd time. This time he said I was rapidly losing sight in my right eye and needed a series of shots starting IMMEDIATELY. I asked if this could several weeks  and he insisted it couldn't. Nonetheless, I did not agree to the shots. Instead, he shot a laser into my eye, and 2 months later I sought a 2nd opinion from Dr. Brass (Latham). He found my sight to be nearly identical to an eyeglass prescription I received 2 years earlier. I just saw Brass for a 6 month check-up &amp; he reports that my vision is unchanged and my right eye has healed.",Male
"Almost 2 years ago, I developed several large floaters in both eyes, obscuring my vision. I went to my ophthalmologist. First, he made me wait 6 months to see if the floaters would go away. When that didn't happen, we started laser surgeries. He said that I would need several but that I would see improvement after each one. After 4 surgeries in each eye, $2100 out of pocket, and over a year, I saw no improvement. I was so discouraged. I was scheduled for more surgeries but had little hope. Then, my niece started working for Ophthalmic Consultants and mentioned my situation to Dr. Rabady. He was immediately concerned and told her to tell me to make an appointment to see him - that he could help me. I did and very soon after, he did the first Vitrectomy. A few days ago, he did the second. My vision is now crisp and clear! No floaters! I am so happy that I found Dr. Rabady. I think it was fate that my niece started working for his group! He is kind and caring and I'm grateful to him!",Male
"I would like to start by thanking Dr. Rabady in the highest regards to his opinions, professionalism and execution. The entire staff is always helpful. We thank him on behalf of my 85 yr. old mother Who had a complete diabetic detachment and horrible Vitreous hemorrhage in her right eye. In a short amount of time the surgical procedure repaired her detachment and within a week her vision came back. Although most office visits are lengthy you have to consider the population needing these services and practices available. Thank you again,

"Dr. Rabady successfully performed a very delicate procedure to remove scar tissue from the retina of my eye that was severely distorting my vision. The immediate results of the surgery exceeded my expectations and my eyesight continues to improve. I am very pleased with his skill and pre/post op care.

I was in Dr. Rabady's office the next morning and scheduled for surgery immediately.

"A detached retina  x2 , each eye once. Dr. Rabady got me into Surgery same day. Repaired and better than ever. Will you wait in an appt? Yes. Your going to get dialated, it takes time. 45-60 mins is the norm. You check in, a tech does the initial. Another Tech checks the vision, pressures and starts dialation. You will wait a little time for dialation. You'll go in and see Dr. Rabady. Took his time, thorough and answered any questions. Highly Recommend.",Male
"If floaters are annoying you, call Dr. David Rabady today. We highly recommend him. Recently I took my 85-year old Mom, Carol W., to see Dr. David Rabady for surgery on floaters in both of her eyes. The right eye surgery in May and the left eye surgery in August were both successful and easy (her words). When she tells people about having those annoying floaters removed, they are surprised that anything can be done about them! Dr. Rabady alleviated all of her concerns and did a great job.",Male

Based on this success I have over come my fear of this surgery and I will have my right eye surgery in 2 weeks. Thanks Dr Rabady !",Male
I was very rushed after waiting for over half an hour in the waiting room and 15 minutes in the exam room.  He seemed rushed and preoccupied and I did not feel that al of my questions were answered.  After he left the room I found out he had a surgery to get to.  Understandable but he frightened me with concerns about my eye and I was very stressed.  Because of his youth and inexperience he was wrong about his concerns and I did not need to seek intervention in Philadelphia,Male
"I was diagnosed with a detached retina by another doctor. Dr Rabady stayed after the end of his scheduled day until I could get to his office. He successfully repaired my damaged retina the next day, during his lunch break, after traveling to the surgery center from another office. I have 100% vision! He was patient, thorough, compassionate, answered all my questions, &amp; when I had more questions the next day, got on the phone himself. I can recommend him without reservation. He's the best! :)",Male
"I put a lot of effort into searching for a doctor after moving to Merced. I found Dr. Rabago at MFA G street accepting new patients and he had great reviews. He moves around to different offices on certain days. Dr. Rabago is quick to act running labs, prescribing medication, and handling referrals. I feel comfortable with him. The only down side is it may be several weeks out for an appointment at the MFA office. Staff there are friendly and helpful; the seating in the waiting room is the best. My visits are always on time and fairly quick. These days it’s difficult to find a good doctor that listens and acts but you won’t have to worry about that with Dr. Rabago.",Male

He understands your level of experience and tailors his explanations to it. For example, I study biology. He does not go over the basic items because he knows that I understand the terminology. I feel that this is important because it makes me feel more comfortable and that I am given credit for my own experience as well.",Male

Dr Rabalais and her staff have always been super friendly and helpful.  She came highly recommend and after asking her understand why.  She listens and explains things is a manner that is understandable.  Can’t imagine going anywhere else!,Female
I went to see Dr. Rabalais for hearing loss. I had been told by other medical professionals that it could be caused by a ruptured eardrum or an intractable eustachian tube problem. Dr. Rabalais instantly suspected that none of these diagnoses were accurate and that the problem was ear wax. She used a suction device to clear the wax and uncover my eardrum. Instantly my hearing was restored to what it was before. I would highly recommend Dr. Rabalais to anyone seeing an ENT doctor. ,Female

Dr. Her office was great with scheduling and answering any questions I had. I would highly recommend Dr. Rabalais for any and all ENT needs.,Female
My son went to her and wasn't satisfied with her.  He complained for 4 months and then he decided to get a lawyer involved.  The next thing we know she called him in and said he had cancer and sent him to a doctor over 70 miles away. I'm not a doctor but I am a mother and my gut tells me she lying to cover up a mistake she did.  I hope to God what she doing in the dark comes to the light. She need to be stopped.  She lies a lot and she will say anything to right her wrong.,Female
I had a wax buildup in my ear that was causing hearing loss and pain.  Dr Rabalais was able to carefully remove it without causing additional pain in the process.  She also recommended treatment to prevent buildup in the future.  ,Female

"Excellent.  Care, Concern, Referral and Follow Up 18 yrs.",Male
Doctors are meant to show solution to the problem not to be visited forever. For my cholesterol and pre diabetes conditions he asked me to take tablets forever. If I have to take tablets forever then I don't see a need to visit the doctor. Doctor must have short term approach and solutions that help in long run. Must explain why the problem might have occurred at such an young age and what is to be done to cure. Wrong approach and wrong diagnosis. With natural food and reduced meditation I am getting healed faster than with meditation,Male
"Have seen Dr. Rabara a few times since 2018. He is friendly, thorough, asks pertinent questions and listens to my concerns. He is quick in responding on MyChart and even called me personally on Christmas Eve one year to check on my status since I had the flu. I appreciate his manner and his care of me as a patient. I saw him initially because my normal dr. wasn’t available for an appt. I switched to him as my dr after that because I was so impressed.",Male
Very poor bedside manner. He completely rushed through the appointment. I was not even able to communicate my ailments due to his interruption. I felt he just wanted to leave for the day rather than properly assessing my medical situation. Will NEVER see this doctor again!,Male
"I needed an appointment asap so took whatever time &amp; Doctor I could get..  I got an evening appt with Dr Rabara, whom I had never seen before.

The medical student with him was also very nice. (Joe)",Male
Dr. Rabassa already impressed me in April 2016 when he performed an emergency operation on my father of 93 years old and saved his life.

"Did not take my concerns seriously. Told me I could keep in touch through the patient portal. That has been a disaster. Practice is so busy, I felt I was in the production line of a factory.

She was rushed and I had to ask her twice to wait so that I could ask her some questions. Then, after she left, she sent a message through her nurse to stop taking a medication for my chronic condition. She couldn't be bothered to talk to me about it, and then refused to renew my prescription. She can't be trusted.",Female

"Most definitely and already recommended her to people.
She is the best and I enjoy being her patient",Female

We have never walked out on an appointment before! RUN DON""T WALK away from this doctor!!!!",Female
Dr. Rabazzi takes a more holistic approach which means she will not treat your problem. I went in for a physical and asked for tests she refused to give me or didn't know what kind of test to send me for. It's clear she has no idea what she is doing. She will miss clear illnesses. Your life can depend on your doctor and I would not depend on her to help you. She also has quite an attitude about her that is off putting. ,Female

"Dr. Rabbani is a phenomenal doctor who actually listens and provides the best treatment plan possible. From the moment I walked into the office, my experience was nothing other than positive. I found the front office staff very friendly and inviting. After seeing a few psychiatrists in the area, I would recommend him to anyone who wants someone who will address your needs and is attentive and caring.",Male
"This man is a terrible doctor. He refused to prescribe me meds that I've been taking since 2007 and in general just had a rude, unsympathetic attitude and basically just spent 20 minutes telling me that he would not be transferring my meds that have been prescribed to me by my WELL QUALIFIED Psychiatrists in the past.. AND THEN HE CHARGES ME $350 for the visit!! When I asked him for a refund he told me that I had my ""evaluation"" and would not be giving me a refund. Don't go see this Dr!",Male
Horrible! Didn't do anything he said he would.,Male
Third visit- very condescending and dismissive. I will not be going back.,Female
"The worst experience I have ever had with a doctor. She was not kind or empathetic, and her interrogatory manner of asking questions was very uncomfortable. I couldn't get a word  in edge wise. I left the  office crying.",Female
I am always very satisfied with the help e everyone gives me at the office.  They all are very professional and helpful.,Female
A very good doctor. Great listener explores all options. Well  experience and  pays attention to detail. Would recommend her.,Female
She knows what she’s talking about and is very compassionate,Female
Dr. Mika was very professional and took the time to listen to all of my concerns and genuinely seemed interested in my well being. I felt very comfortable with her and her staff.,Female
She took her time and discussed my concerns in depth with me. She’s both compassionate and very intelligent. Was very impressed by her and intend on seeing her for years to come.,Female
Worst experience with a doctor that I have ever had.  Very dismissive and in a hurry to diagnose without completely listening/examining a patient.  Her treatment choice was very risky considering my individual health situation and was documented incorrectly as well.  Received a second opinion later that day that was in complete disagreement and felt her treatment choice was dangerous.  ,Female
Dr. Mika took her time and was very detailed with her explanations regarding my medical concerns. I did not feel rushed at all (which is rare these days). Fabulous doctor! So happy I found her. ,Female
Dr. Mika is very professional and empathetic with me. She listens to my concerns and offers excellent options for my needs. She doesn’t make me feel rushed when I come in. ,Female
"I have been a patient of Dr Muslah for the past 4 years. Services have been so good and thorough, all of my medical conditions-diabetes management, cancer, kidney stone managementt, that several family members have accepted Dr Muslah for their own personal physician.",Male

"After experiencing a head trauma, Dr Samuel and his office were extremely responsive to get me the medical attention I needed. Dr Samual is extremely knowledgeable and has the state of the art medical facility in La Quinta ",Male
"After 4 months with another Doctor I considered  stopping all visual injections for macula. The pain, mental stress and blood shot eyes were unbearable.

I changed clinics.    Dr Samuel and his staff are the best.  Very professional, no pain and answers all my questions.",Male
Everyone is so professional and caring. They really have their act together. A well run office. Dr. Samuel is thorough and to the point. I know I am in good hands. Thank you!,Male
"Am absolutely 10. This was the best shot in my eye ever with no pain once I left. Dr Michael Samuel is great. He is  a 10, therefore retina institute of ca is a 10",Male

Excellent service and professional staff,Male

Yes  Very patient friendly . Takes the time to discuss case with patient. I feel very comfortable   as his patient  and know he will do whats best for my eye condition.  I would have no problem recommending him  to others.",Male
"My appointment with Dr. Samuel was perfect. Everyone was professional, efficient and Dr Samuel took the time to answer my questions. Several MDs should emulate his practice. Thank you! ",Male
"Honestly, I never leave reviews unless I have something good to say. But, this has been the worst healthcare experience of my life. I booked an appointment with the ophthalmologist for urgent issues (cannot go outside, drive, etc due to extreme light sensitivity). He saw me for literally 3 minutes, told me my retinas were ok, diagnosed me with dry eye, and REFUSED to help with it. They literally walked out of the door telling me I had to make a follow up appointment with a different ophthalmologist for that, despite pleading with the doctor &amp; front desk. The entire thing felt like an obvious attempt to squeeze money out of my insurance at the expense of my pain &amp; disability. I voiced my concerns directly to both Dr. Samuel and the front desk before writing this review but they took no action to rectify the situation.",Male
Absolutely amazing as usual.,Male
"The staff is great. The office is clean and safe. Dr Samuels is marvelous. Already told others to go there. Thx for a great first experience. Look 
Forward to seeing you next year.",Male
"My son has been seeing Dr. Samuel for about 8 months. I’m very happy with him. His expertise is invaluable. Dr. Samuel treats my son with care &amp; respect,  my son has special needs. As his mother this is very important to me.",Male
"Did several tests for diabetic retinopathy even though I do not have diabetes, then says he doesn’t know what is wrong because I do not have diabetes and the tests for diabetic retinopathy are negative. Never looked at the surgery site for the repaired retina tear which he was supposed to monitor after another dr performed the surgery but was too far away for continued follow up. Said he had no idea why I was having problems and basically couldn’t be having problems because I do not have diabetes. Went back to the original practice and they found the problem in a few minutes by just actually looking at my eye and not the angiogram which doesn’t even look at the area I was having problems with.",Male
"I was in Palm Springs this past weekend for a wedding when I had this flood of floaters. I called the office Monday morning and they couldn’t have been nicer arranging for me to see Dr. Samuel. He, as well as all his staff, were professional, kind, thorough and made me feel at ease and reassured. I am so grateful for his time and expertise. I highly recommended him.",Male
"I was interested in becoming part of an experimental group at USC exploring the use of stem cells for the treatment of dry macular degeneration.  On the basis of Dr. Samuel's evaluation, I was accepted.  After two days of testing they and I discovered his acuity evaluation was totally inaccurate and that my eyesight as too good to include me in this particular study (which was for the safety of this procedure with humans),  For me this was good news but his report wasted project time and money.",Male
"Doctor is very nice and knows what he is doing.  His staff, however, don't care about patients or filing insurance claims correctly.  After almost 3 months of trying to get through to someone, I still don't have my insurance claim filed correctly, and the office manager is never when I call or when the insurance company calls trying to get this fixed.  She won't return calls either - just keeps sending the wrong info in.

Office reeks of incense, and makes it hard to breathe in the waiting room.",Male
Have had nothing but excellent experiences with Dr Solano who I have been seekng for over 4 years. Highly recommend!,Male
Had both eyes done with cataracts and one with glaucoma as well. Excellent care and i see beautifully with both eyes. Dr. Solano was very comforting during the whole surgery. He also has beautiful eyes. Lol Highly recommend!,Male
"Horrible bedside manner!! Short, rude, abrupt, and hurried in his patient consult, leaving my poor uninformed father with questions regarding treatment options for his glaucoma and deteriorating eyesight. He was left alone with his assistant in the exam room through which he had to ask his quesstions. While the Dr. Answered from another room. No regard or concern for the patient!",Male
"He is now practicing in Palm Desert, CA for Acuity Eye Specialists.  He is a charlatan. He tried to get me to schedule cataract surgery that would cost $3600 out-of-pocket.  He was deceptive in implying that the extra cost was for a special lens, but when I pinned him down, the lens would be a monofocal lens, completely covered by my insurance.  Then he said the extra cost was because he would be using laser surgery, which the Mayo Clinic doesn't even recommend when implanting a monofocal lens.",Male
He is very thorough in his exam. He is respectful and listens to what I have to say.,Male
"Knowledgeable, and caring doctor!",Male
Was 10 minutes late because of snow storm and was refused service and the waiting room was empty.  I’m without mediation,Male
"Wonderful Dr. he has helped me so much over the years, very kind and considerate.",Male
Was my moms physician was very kind and compassionate to her. He took the time to explain things to her and was getting her off the steroids slowly and this was helping her. He is very knowledgeable and I would highly recommended him and his staff to anyone looking for a arthritis physician.,Male
"I was pleased that he was knowledgeable about the disease.  I would like to have had more time to ask additional questions, I felt a bit rushed.  I will say tho when I had a flare, he was willing to see me immediately.  Still felt rushed that day too.  ",Male
"Great doctor, knowledgeable, caring. Recommended. ",Male
I am looking for a new rheumatologist after being with this clinic for many years. My old  Dr. Left the practice and I got   stuck with Dr. Sa Leitao. He  has treated me horribly. The  short amount of time he has  spent with me has been rudeness  and arrogance.  I have never  had a Dr. Treat me in this manner .  He comes in the room with  his hand on the doorknob and  leaves in 30 seconds. There is  no way I am going back even  tho I like every person in that  clinic. I hate that I have to leave,Male
I really appreciate the time spent with tu me and taking the time to diagnose the cause of my pain (so unlike previous rheumatologist). ,Male
Very nice place very comfortable ,Male
"Very thorough, takes the time to listen to all your concerns. ",Male
"I would highly recommend Dr. Sa Leitao to anyone with R/A.  He is compassionate, and listens to your concerns about medicine's that are out there for treatment.   What is important to me is the fact that he cares about the Pain I am in, and want to find a solution. His staff is helpful and nice.  I have never had to wait to see him.  Dr. Sa Leita is a great R/A Dr.  I am glad I have him on my side.  Hope this was helpful.",Male
great doctor,Male
I would NOT recommend Dr Sa Leitao to anyone with a Chronic Illness. He is rude and arrogant.  He does not listen to the patient and over talks them.  He insists things are done his way or you can find another Rheumatologist.  Those were his words to me.  So I am taking his advice and finding a new Rheumatologist. There was no kindness from this Dr. or compassion for me.  He cares nothing about chronic plain and would rather have his patients in pain. Shame on Borgess for not having a better Dr!,Male
"My wife was 15 minutes late to her appointment. Dr. Sa'Adah indicated she should get another doctor to be treated for her depression. Are you kidding me? I have never met a more irresponsible, callous MD. She refused to fill my wife's anti-depression medicine.   My wife left the office crying and proceeded to have an anxiety attack and was hysterical.    Thank you Dr. Sa'Adah. Your oath is to do no harm. I suggest you refresh why you decided to be a physician.  And I warn any new patients to find another doctor for she is not competent if she handles patients this way. I will be filing a complaint with the medical board.",Female
"I've had the pleasure of having become a new patient under the care of Dr. Sa'adh. When I inquired about making an appointment, she called personally to schedule an appointment, which was made with a good deal of flexibility and within a reasonable timeframe. The office has ample parking, and was not difficult to find. Dr. Sa'adh sent over all the necessary paperwork, and reviewed its respective contents prior to the scheduled appointment. She was courteous, kind, and attentive. In a situation that was otherwise quite embarrassing, her empathetic nature and evident knowledge were very reassuring. My initial prescription is pending prior authorization, which she prepared me to anticipate thus eliminating any conflict between myself and the pharmacy. I feel comfortable contacting her in the event of a needed dosage adjustment in advance of our next scheduled appointment time, or for any other matter. Very pleased thus far and I would recommend to others. ",Female
Dr. Saa is literally the best!!! ,Female
Great doctor. Doesn't just push meds like most. Does actual physical work ups to make sure medication is safe for you and listens to what is going on. He's in this field for all the right reasons.,Male
"Dr. Saa, is an amazing Psychiatrist.  The first psychiatrist in many years that not only have I had an successful experience in with treating me but he is also, PATIENT, and KIND, and very KNOWLEDGEABLE and up most the most RESPECTFUL DR.! He is always available to be there when needed!  I highly recommend him to anyone who is need of a great psychiatrist. ",Male
"Never would recommend .   Grade  F    

Mr Saa, because he does NOT deserve to be addressed as a doctor. He did not once speak with family  nor did he return the 8 phone calls which were placed to him directly from the hospital staff, which held up discharge from hospital for over 8 hours.  other arrangements had to be made for discharge.  

UNPROFESSIONAL.",Male
Excellent Dr. who you can talk to and ask questions. He is a very caring person who gives excellent advice and is very knowledgable. He is friendly and I drive an hour to his office because he is worth the long ride. If you have a 3:00 appointment your appointment will start exactly at 3:00. No wait because he doesn't double book. His staff is excellent and will go out of their way to help you. I am so glad I found Dr.Saa and wish other dr's ran their practices like he does. A+,Male
Great doctor. I’ve been seeing him for over 1 year. He’s very informative and gives you all the options for your health care.,Male
I have to take six buses and walk a mile and a half plus to get to his office and back home. This takes over three hours . He refuses to write me three prescriptions that will last me 90 days. This  would save me two trips to the office every 90 days. He said he had a bad  experience with another patient so he won't write three prescriptions for 90 days for me. Very nice of him to  make it easy for me to only have to go once every 90 days... NOT! So he slaps me in the face with that remark and,Male
This is by far the best hcp office I have been to. Dr. Saab is the best Dr. They have had there since Dr. Kristina Shurtleff left that company to start her own practice.  I personally believe he cares about his patients. He is the first Dr. I have been to in the last Vegas area that actually gave me a hands on exam. He didn't just look at me and prescribe a useless medicine.  I love doctors that are confident about their craft. I will continue to go there. Thank you Dr. Saab and staff. ,Male
First appointment with doctor Saab 1h40 m wait to see the doctor.Will explain everything,Male
"First time i've seen him at the Gallery Office. Thinks he's g-d.  Talks over you.  Won't let you finish your sentence.  Tells you how to take a new medicine &amp; how to increase the dosage.  During the visit, he told me 3 times on how to take the medicine, THEN he changes it.  So which is correct?  Said that the medicine I've been taking for 8 years will kill me...duh, I'm still here.",Male
"Wouldn't refill my basic medicine, even after numerous  phone calls. I'm having to switch doctors. He is crabby, doesn't make eye contact, leaves at the end of appointment abruptly, and doesn't address all issues.",Male
"Took time, listened, willing to learn &amp; not rushed. He is now in Lansing, MI at Capital Cardiology across from Sparrow Hospital.",Male
This doctor needs to slow down and listen to his patients. My husband didn’t even have time to ask questions. He spoke so fast that we could barely understand his specially with his accent. Prescribed my husband medication that we didn’t even know he prescribed till we went to our pcp and the nurse asked if he was still taking them. Would never recommend this doc even to a enemy. When asking the nurse y he spoke so quickly she said laughing “ it must be the espresso” wow is only thing I can say to a heart doc hyped on caffeine.,Male
very impersonable. Has an idea how to treat you and doesn't bother to listen to details of your visit. His staff is very rude and do NOT give results until the 6 week follow-up appointment. Was given a heart monitor that wasn't looked at until then!!,Male
"Dr Saab insisted that a chemical stress test for my heart was less chance of a heart attack than physical, but also said I had no exercise restrictions.  When you check the drug he wanted to inject, the FDA says it should only be used on patients incapable of doing a physical test, which I am not, and that there is a risk of heart attack and death in a memo from 2013.  So he is not aware of the drugs he is using, possibly with fatal consequences.  His nurse was rude when I called",Male
I've utilized the services of Dr. Abou-Saab for four years and Dr. Abou-Saab has been very personable to me. His problem is the association with Tower Health which has turned into a money-only entity. This has caused a trickle-down process affecting the office personnel of affiliated doctors.,Male
"amazing doctor, best I've ever had. so caring and willing to help all patients.",Male
"Offended &amp; confused - 2 things you should never feel after leaving seeing your doctor. I came to Dr. Saab after newfound issues with bloating. His summary was that it was a ""lifestyle problem"" &amp; scolded me for cutting yogurt out of my diet. Let me explain that I am a healthy and young individual. I do not smoke, do drugs, or drink alcohol in excess. I eat healthy, go to the gym, &amp; go to sleep on time. I have no other medical issues. I would NOT recommend - only if you like to waste time and $$$.",Male
Refused to treat my mother (a patient) when her son became crazy in his office. Instead of throwing out the son my mother is now in hospital due to refusal of care. Totally incompetent &amp; will be responsible if my mother dies. One month or more WITHOUT TREATMENT. A disgrace!!!!! He forgot the oath he took to treat the sick. Utter INCOMPETENCE &amp; misjudgment !,Male
"I met Dr. Abou-Saab for the first time yesterday. This was my first experience at this clinic. Staff were friendly, wait time was short. I have  a few  medical problems, I was there for med refills and a physical. Dr. Saab was very concerned that I had been off meds for a long time due to insurance reasons and filled them all. He was concerned for my health; wanted me to get bloodwork and physical. I was given a follow up appt. for that. It's hard to see a new doctor. I was put at ease.",Male
Very knowledgeable and attentive. Makes himself available. Very thankful for all he has done for me.,Male

"I saw Dr. Saab a year ago at UPenn, after being passed around the medical system, desperate and with little avail. Dr Saab takes his job like the calling it is. He sat with me extensively and reverently, and listened to my medical history and symptoms (probably for an hour), and was informative and asked questions when applied. He tested me as thoroughly as possible, and when my tests were inconclusive, sat with me another hour to map  who else to see, what little else I could be tested for after a 5 year relentless search. He offered to call and brainstorm with my other doctors and asked me to get in touch with him when I finally got a diagnosis. I have seen dozens of good doctors over the years, but unfortunately not enough do that. Dr. Saab is the gold standard. And I will forever recommend him to those I know.",Male

I had a colonoscopy by Dr. Saad on December 18th.  He took several polyps and sent them to the lab for analysis.  Now it is January 21st and I have received no results.

We just love you.!",Male
"He is a very thorough Doctor. He will explain things to you so you understand. He will answer all your questions as fully as he can. He is a very neat, friendly Doctor who puts you at ease soon as you meet him and so is his nurse. I filly recommend him to all my family and friends. Thank you Dr. Saad",Male
"Dr. Saad and his staff care deeply about the wellbeing of their clients. When my severest symptoms threatened my life (while I was in another state), they moved mountains to ensure I got the meds &amp; care I needed until I could get to NY for my surgery which went perfectly and I have my health back &amp; owe it to Dr. Saad. He made special effort to see me (post surgery) during the shutdown. He's the kind of wonderful, caring doctor who goes beyond what is required that most folks wish they had but don't and I am so thankful for him.",Male
"Happy about the care at Women's Health Pavilion. However, as a first time mom especially disappointed and frustrated with no visitor policy which is not backed up with any scientific data. We do know from studies that with short interactions the risk of transmission is negligible, thus by having partner present in the room with mask on during ultrasound which is literally 5 mins, you are not increasing the risk.  I'm a health care provider myself in the hospital and we do allow visitors in the ICU and we have not seen any uptake in cases for months. And none of the other offices around Nassau county has such a restrictive policy. With this policy in place, we are restricting the new fathers from their basic right. I urge the administrators of this office to review their policy so the partner can be present. I know how important this is for me emotionally. I'm pretty sure the other new moms to be who are in the boat will appreciate this as well.",Male
Dr. Saad was and has remained compassionate through the years that I've been his patient.  He  answers all your questions to the best of his ability.  Makes you feel 'at home.' Remains very professional but puts you at ease regardless of your medical isssues. I highly recommend Dr. Saad.,Male
"Dr. Saad is a lifesaver. I suffered with fibroids, flooding clots, and misery for almost 3 decades and finally after the hysterectomy Dr. Saad performed, I have my life back. The surgery went flawlessly and had I known what a great outcome I'd have due to Dr. Saad's expertise, I would have done this procedure years ago. If you have gyn issues and want them resolved by the best doctor in this field, don't delay and go see Dr. Saad for a solution. All I have to say is- Thank God for Dr. Saad!",Male
He is an excellent Physician. Provides the best care. He answers all question I ask and provides a great care plan. I highly recommend Dr. Saad.,Male
"Dr Saad was compassionate and assured me that my surgery could be scheduled within a month. It has been four weeks since my surgery for hysterectomy due to endometriosis, which weakened my uterus leading to severe prolapse, adhesions on my abdominal wall, fibroids, cysts, and adhesion of my uterus to other organs. Despite suffering cerebral blood clots and UV fistula a year ago, and the additional risks associated, Dr Saad was able to complete it, without complications, in less than two hours.",Male
Dr. Saad has been my doctor for over 24 years since my first child and I can say he's the most wonderful person you can have as your OBGYN.

I have had the pleasure to meet both senior and junior and they are the best at what they do.,Male
"Dr. Saad helped me when 2 other doctors wouldn’t touch me due to a blood clot. I suffered with severe fibroids issues and was losing massive amounts of blood. His plan of action was to keep an eye on my blood and iron levels then perform a hysterectomy. It’s in the infancy stages of the surgery,  but has been amazing. It’s life altering. Dr. Saad has great bed side manner and I couldn’t be more pleased with the care I’ve been given. He’s awesome as is the entire staff.",Male
"Dr. Saad is the best! Simply the best! I am not at a point in my life where I am planning to become pregnant, but I do know that when I do I would and plan to have Dr. Saad be my physician to deliver my future children!

My son is about to turn 2 and after he turned 1 he stared to get sick pretty often..the last time was when this whole Covid 19 stared he took my call make sure we didn’t have any COVID symptoms and decided to take my son into the office..but every time I have any concerns they try to accommodate an apt the same day!!!

"Our family has had nothing but positive experiences with Dr. Saad and Dr. Dagher. They are both caring and competent physicians who we trust completely. We have come to know their office staff over the years, and they are real people who care about their job duties. I cannot say that about many medical office staffs I've had the displeasure of encountering over the years. Is this place perfect? No, no such place exists. But this practice puts the well being of their patients BEFORE all else. ",Male

"I recently had to change pediatricians due to my insurance. Dr.Saad came very highly recommended. I can honestly say that both doctors are very nice. However, I'm used to a doctor who is thorough and a staff that takes care of us. I missed my son's last two checkups because I didn't even know they were due,we missed two months of immunizations! I'm so upset! I only found out because I had to take my other son in for an illness. We waited almost an hour after our appointment for a 10 min visit.",Male

Dr. Saad is a brilliant surgeon who had to work with a pretty messed up shoulder and he did a very professional job! very little, I mean, tiny scaring on my shoulder. His staff is awesome, I'm pretty much a  Scaredy cat when it comes to surgery and they made feel very comfortable and less anxious.

Dr. Saad indicated he had to perform a procedure wherein he would be aspirating fluid out of my mom's shoulder to rule out infection.

"Dr. Saad performed a Subachromial Decompression on my shoulder this past December. He took my complaint of pain (how it affected my personal and professional life) seriously. I had very little pain associated with the surgery--only one OTC Tylenol was taken (no kidding). He referred me to Waterworks PT for rehab,  which is affiliated with Michigan Orthopedics Associates. Over three months later, I can confidently say that my impingement has been relieved. Thank you, Dr. Saad! ",Male

 ",Male
After being in an auto accident and having lots of tingling in my shoulder and arm I had an MRI showing a tear in my liberal I found Dr. Saad on line. He examined me and listened and then told me he thought most of my pain was actually coming from my neck. He always has your best interest in mind. He will always make sure he explains everything before making a decision together. I have told everybody Dr. Saad has taken care of 3 surgeries and each time the pain I had was gone after Surgery.,Male
"Dr Saad is a caring compassionate doctor who never tells you what to do, but discusses the options available to you to continue doing what you enjoy. He is on top of newest treatments and procedures and in some instances like my husbands, he truly performed a miracle! 
He is always available to his patients, and greets you with a smile, he listens and he doesn't rush. I would definitely recommend him for shoulder repair. He did a outstanding job on both of us!",Male
"Great doctor and staff.  Positive experience from diagnose, to surgery, after care and therapy!  Dr. Saad and his staff took time to answer my questions, listen to me and made sure my after care healing was where it should be.  My experience went from being skeptical of surgery....to being able to say my shoulder is GREAT and I had a caring and skillful doctor to make this happen.   Personality is upbeat and fun....and most of all Dr. Saad cares beyond the day of surgery  :)    ",Male
"In the fast world we live in, it was refreshing to find a physician that is knowledgeable, paused and that truly cared about my health. He took the time to listen to me, then clearly explained details until I understood. His staff is also very courteous and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Saad!",Male
"Excellent caring attitude and a brilliant physician.. after seeing two primary care doctors, a cardiologist and a lung doctor Dr. Saad was the one that finally found my diagnosis and caught my cancer in time. Saved my life! ",Male
"Dr. Saad has been my PCP for the last 2 years, he was very supportive during my family crisis and while my mom was in the hospital. He saw her daily and made sure she got the best care she could. Post discharge he took care of her at the nursing home and my mother is doing very well now. Me and my whole family go to him, and he has been nothing but amazing to all of us. He also helped me loose weight by setting me up on this weight loss regimen that has been very effective! Highly recommend him!",Male
"I first met Dr. Saad at my place of employment. He was one of the attending physicians who came in to see our patients on a weekly basis. After getting to know him and watching him work with his patients, it was very obvious to me that he's one of a kind. It's not common that you find a physician with a great bedside manner who truly listens. Over time, I have recommended Dr. Saad not only to my patients but to my own friends and family. He's a great doctor who I trust!",Male
Dr Saad is one of the best doctors I have had the pleasure to meet.  While I have not known for long he comes highly recommended and he lives up to his reputation.  He is a skilled Internist and has excellent patient skills.  ,Male
Excellent caring attitude.  Listens and tells reasons for his decisions. ,Male
"I originally heard of Dr.Saad from a family member in the healthcare field. I took her advice and so glad I did. Dr. Saad took his time with me to explain my bloodwork line by line. He answered all my questions and took his time with me. You can feel his genuine care for his patients. I am so thankful I switched to have him as my doctor ! Thank you, Dr. Saad! ",Male
Dr. Saad is very kind and caring.  He listens to you and goes over everything (all your medications and concerns) he never makes you feel rushed.  ,Male
"Dr. Saad has been my father's pcp since 2015. My father was diagnosed in October 2016 with liver failure. Dr. Saad has been instrumental in continuing to give my father the best care and keeping in contact with me living out of state. He listens, he cares, he is very thorough. I would recommend him to anyone seeking a pcp!",Male
She is NOT taking new patients,Female
"I only saw her for a year. I was going through major issues and unfortunately, Dr Saad wasn't really there for me.",Female
I saw her for extreme depresion and anxiety. She was compassionate and able to prescribe the medication combination that worked for me. I wish I hadn't moved because I have not had any luck finding someone as wonderful as her.,Female
Dr. Saad is a very caring doctor.  She listens to you and is a calming presence.  I would definitely recommend her for any psychiatric issues.,Female
"Stay away! He is short tempered and a bully.  One might put up with this if he was exemplary in his field, but believe me he is not.",Male
"Terrible. Bully, dismisive, rude. Run!",Male
"I had seen Dr. Saad for over 20 years. In the past, perhaps before Scripps Clinic compressed their doctors' schedules, he was consistently nice, caring, jovial, and excellent as a ENT doctor. In the past couple of years (2018 - 2019), his demeanor has been more unpredictable. When I read some of the 2-star and 3-star reviews about how he does not listen, does not care (though he does care), is rude, etc., that is what I have been experiencing as well. I have decided after over two decades of being his patient to switch to another ENT specialist (with consistent 5-star) reviews, and I will see how that goes. It is sad. But I need a doctor who listens and communicates with me rather than at me. Techinically, I am sure he is an excellent doctor; however, his bedside manner has changed over the years.",Male
" I think Dr. Saad doesn't realize that in trying to ferret out reasons for stuffy nose and one event in which I had true difficulty breathing through nose, that he comes across as an overbearing and insulting interrogator.  He advised me, that if I came back, to bring someone with me.  

That's not likely.





",Male
"I feel so much better reading everyone else's reviews because this visit was abysmal. He didn't listen to a word I said, interrupted me, berated me for not giving him the answers he apparently wanted. I had to have a nurse in the room with me because I was in tears. I just needed help for my symptoms and he treated me like garbage. Then before I left, he tried to talk me out of getting the test I needed because ""most people are fine but you have a sensitive personality so you won't be."" He is a disgrace to the Scripps network. ",Male
Rude and unprofessional. Should never be allowed to practice and continue to hurt patients. Shame on Scripps to have him on your staff.,Male
"Rude,Arrogantand he shouldn't be allowed to practice.  Please do not refer him to anyone.  He doesn't  care about his patients. ",Male
Very gentle man...concerned about my ear procedure and successful.,Male
"Dr. Saad was rude &amp; dismissive to me my first visit. Then he saved my life &amp; my smile. I had a pharyngeal abscess &amp; needed surgery. Dr Saad said it would take 20 minutes &amp; that the incision would be in my neck, &amp; there was a chance I would not smile again. Due to infection, my jaw was locked, so through clenched teeth &amp; tears, I told him I had 2 babies that had to see me smile again. He took 2 hours to pry my mouth open &amp; operate through there instead of my neck. He saved my smile &amp; my life too!",Male
"My experience has been very different. Dr. Saad would not be the Division Chief of Head and Neck Surgery and Otologie at Scripps, if any of those extremely negative reviews were justified. Dr. Saad is a friendly, calm, competent, and highly experienced surgeon. In all my meetings with D. Saad (pre-op, surgery of deviated septum, post-op), I was impressed. He gave easy to understand, common sense instructions, and everything went as planned. Dr. Saad has my full trust and I highly recommend him.",Male
"This man should not be allowed to practice on living beings. Like others, I saw him for a small and benign issue. He described it both pre and post surgery as a small pimple in my tongue. Yet he managed to sever the main muscle in my tongue. Yes he deformed my tongue severely. He would not explain his error and instead gave me painful cortisone shots in the area, perhaps hoping they'd perform a miracle. Also I now understand this is medically dangerous to give so many cortisone shots so quickly.",Male
"Yes, this man shames his patients, hurts them, has offensive breath and should not be in practice. I have had to live with the damage he did to me a number of years back. ",Male
"He is extremely overpriced. He is also, very condescending and rude. He has no bedside manner. I have a bad gag reflex and he placed an instrument up my nose and down my throat. I was in horrible pain and visibly upset. Instead of removing the instrument he continued. He made me feel ashamed for being in pain and upset.

Do not go to this doctor. He is not worth the cost.",Male
Beginning was nice but during the appointment he poked my ear so hard I jumped out of my seat never apologizing for it. Arrogant and not sensitive to patients. Will never return to him.,Male
Arrogant and dismissive of my concern.,Male
"Very attentive, knowledgable and professional. ",Male
"I am really concerned for the welfare of his patients because he demonstrates inappropriate behaviors, arrogant, ignorant, and just plainly a mean person. I don’t understand how a man like him is eligible to practice as a healthcare provider/MD. He  completely lacks the basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology. This is your fair warning. For your own health and life, request someone health. I wish my family member still could. ",Male
"TERRIBLE! He WAS &amp; IS The WORST DOCTOR (if even he IS a Doctor! Of which I highly Doubt &amp; heard rumours to the cobtrary) He is a Puppet and NOT a Doctor! Never, ever read my charts &amp; reduced my medication - WHO DOES THAT!
I believe this Doctor is not a licensed M.D. Never took any interest &amp; thought I was his PREVIOUS patient on my 1st visit! 
Instead of checking my real concern he wanted to check my back! NOT THE PROBLEM, DOC! WHATS THE MATTER WITH YOU? Do yourself a favor &amp; steer clear away!",Male
"  Dr josephine is highly care about her patients , The staff working there are so nice it is easy to keep contact with her,but unfortunately i waited too much ",Female
Very professional.. very friendly.. she knows exactly wt she is doing.. she delivered my baby as easy as it can be.. Im grateful she is my doctor.,Female
"My Daddy has been going to Dr Saad for a few yrs. When my Mama calls to make or verify an appointment NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE!! After 3 wks of her leaving messages with no response, I called &amp; left another one. After my call, they called back the next day but “does not know anything about her multiple calls”. They schedule appointments on holidays &amp; will not answer the phone or call the patients to cancel appointments during inclement weather either! A staff can ruin the patient’s trust in a Dr cause it sure did my family! They like Dr Saad when they did get to see her just not an unreliable staff.",Female
"Worth the wait! Long wait time 2 hours, but worth it. She was very thorough, first time ever I had such a thorough doctor!",Female
"Dr Saad was a great doctor. However her staff needs training. When I left my visit on 8/15/19 I was scheduled to have an MRI and Dr Saad told the girl at the front desk to schedule me an appointment a week after labor day for the results of my MRI, she said she would have to call me because their computers were down. I have called and left messages 3 times in the last 2 weeks and have yet to get a return call. I think she needs to fire her staff and get new ones. When I called yesterday I told them if I didn't receive a call by Friday I would be coming to the office on Monday to get an appointment. I recommend Dr Saad but not her STAFF!!!!!!!",Female
"You have to wait to see Dr Saad but she’s a fantastic, very thorough doctor. This doctor is willing to spend as long on her patients as needed to do an excellent and thorough evaluation.  It’s well worth any wait because she then spends as much time on you as necessary.  I’d highly recommend this doctor as one who is knowledgeable, thorough, interested, caring about each and every patient. She leaves no stone unturned to get patients the help they need for their problem
This doctor obviously loves her job and her patients and it shows in her level of care. I’d highly recommend Dr Saad.",Female
I have never been referred to an office that will not answer the phone or call back after I leave 4 messages. My sister was a patient and really liked Dr Saad years ago. Not sure if she just doesn’t want anymore patients or not but she needs to answer the phone and let people know that instead of ignoring everyone. I had to give her one star cause there wasn’t a lower one. Do not use this office. They have no concerns of any patients,Female
"My 80 year old mother had a stroke and needed a neurologist to review her head MRI and records to determine lingering problems. This doctor was referred and took 8 weeks to be seen at which time she had no medical records and scheduled my mother to be seen again. The 2nd visit Dr. Saad's staff were horribly rude and Saad would not see my mother. A trainee did and still had no records. They tried to set up a 3rd visit. My mother said no. Incompetent doctor, nasty staff. See a different doctor.",Female
Amazing doctor! She is not about the money she is all about patient care. She has actually set me up wuth every doctor I see. Since I lost my son she is also totally dedicated to my mental health on top of already treating me for a brain injury. Love love Dr Saad,Female
"In all fairness, I have not seen Dr. Saad. My doctor sent a referral, but Dr. Saad office did not call me. I called them twice before getting a call. Unfortunately, the call was on a Friday and the office is closed on Friday.  I called and left a message with the messaging service. To ensure the doctor's office got my message, another call was placed on Monday. No return call. After several days, another call was placed. I still have not been able to schedule an appointment.  ",Female
"Dr. Saad has been my Neurologist for 8 years. She has been able to help me restore my mobility and continues to assist me in retaining the physical goals I have achieved plus moving forward to attain goals for my future mobility and physical achievements! I respect and admire her desire to make each of us, her patients, as well as we can be?",Female
"Dr. Saad was excellent, very thorough and easy to talk to.  Also, she has great support staff, they were all very kind and helpful. Furthermore, I haven't seen such great service or help in the health industry in the last 10 years.  Dr. Sadd and her practice are awesome!",Female
"I arrived with my Mother for a long scheduled appt today with Dr Saad.  She is an elderly patient who has seen Dr Saad for 15 years+   A note on the office door stated that all appts for the day had been cancelled, and please call to reschedule.  I had NOT been notified of this cancellation; NO ONE from the office had called to alert that the appt was cancelled.  Inexcusable, Insensitve, and completely disrespectful of the patient!!",Female
"After reading all the reviews, I was a little nervous about my first appointment. I did wait three hours in the waiting room, but when I met the Dr, it was well worth the wait. She truly cares about her patients. I'm a little confused about all the statements concerning the rudeness of her staff. I have dealt with them in person and on the phone and they have been professional and courteous. I highly recommend Dr Saad",Female
"I like Dr. Saad, but her office is a disorganized disaster.  I saw her for a couple of years until she just stopped doing Botox injections -- she cancelled my appointment and never rescheduled.  Her office never returned any phone calls.  Even after I drove to the office 3 different times to ask what was going on, I never got an answer.  Even before this occurred, when you did have an appointment, if the wait time VERY long -- HOURS. You better take a sack lunch with you.",Female
"Dr Saad deserves a 10 star rating. Very knowledgeable and doesn’t just look at pulmonary issues, but other systems that may effect breathing problems.",Male

"Dr. Saad is the most compassionate, involved, knowledgeable doctor we have ever met. Because of his passion and dedication to his patients, my husband is still alive. He went above and beyond his call of duty (day and night) to make sure everything possible was done for my husband. He is not just a doctor, and his patients are not just a number. I would recommend him to anyone is search of pulmonary care. He will hold a special place in our hearts forever. ",Male
"The most compassionate and caring doctor I have ever encountered.  Dr. Saad cared for my husband who was terminally ill and he cared for both of us emotionally. 
I watched Dr Saad kneel beside my husband 's hospital bed and explain in detail every procedure that became necessary.  The evening Dr. Saad told me that no more could be done and death was eminent, he stayed all night at the nurses station very nearby. 
I will be forever grateful to this brilliant doctor who goes beyond all expectation",Male

"Worst experience of my life with Dr. Saad. He performed a pace maker surgery on me with no anesthesia and I was wide awoke. Despite my screaming and crying, he kept cutting with no regards for my pain. I was told later he used lidocaine and fentanoyl during surgery. They told me during prep that the table was small so they tied my wrist to the table. Evidently they knew they were going to inflict a lot of pain on me before they started. No anesthesiologist was even present in the room.",Male
she's pretty cool,Female
"I unfortunately have seen many Doctors..too many, but Dr.Melissa Saad is an absolute rarity. She listens with the patience of a close friend and takes all you say into account ! The real magic is when she so skillfully connects all the dots and then explains everything in such clear unhurried detail. She removes the gap that almost always exists between Dr. &amp; Patient and leaves your side only when you fully understand and there are no questions or unanswered concerns left to discuss.  D. Fuina ",Female
"My partner was treated by Dr. Saad in the Danbury Hospital emergency room.

"Dr. Saad delayed my surgery for acute appendicitis for 24 hours, causing my appendix to burst.  The hospital I was in did nothing but cover up for this delay, which caused me 5 days hospitalization and unnecessary pain.

"I was referred to Dr. Saad quickly for a routine surgery (gall bladder and bile duct obstruction).  He was thorough in his explanation, and his time allotted to me pre-op.  Even though I felt comfortable, I felt it foolish to not do my homework.  He received rave reviews from everyone with whom I spoke, and lived up to them. completely.  I would be comfortable with his skills in the future and in referring him.  My only displeasure was the length of time I waited to see him.  It was worth it.",Male
"Dr. Saad did emergency surgery on my wife in 2012 and basically saved her life. She had to have a colostomy due to her medical issues. In 2016, my wife only wanted Dr. Saad to reverse her colostomy which he did.

"I wish I would of read the following reviews before going to Dr. Saad. I am currently a Covid patient. This is my email to her:
When we spoke at my appointment I asked you for a cough medicine that would help me sleep. I told you that I didn't do well with NyQuill. You prescribed Benzonatate. This is NOT helping. I was up every 1-2 hours last night.
I would understand if you were hesitant to write it up to me if I had a record of asking for drugs. As you can see in my chart I rarely get sick and seek medical attention.
I don't understand why you are making it more difficult for me.
Let me know if I need to seek medical attention somewhere else.

Her reply was: I am not trying to make it more difficult for you 
You are more than welcome to find a different primary care doctor 
Saad 
THANK YOU FOR HELPING DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME... NO ONE SHOULD EXPERIENCE THIS DURING COVID",Female
Does not pay attention to prescription refill requests and does not respond to urgent hone requests.  Not trustworthy.,Female
Dr. Saad is amazing. She is thorough and thoughtful about her care. I went to her with unexplained pain and she was really adamant about finding the source. I have been dealing with this pain for over a year - I would go as far as to say years. She was able to locate the issue and treat me within a matter of visits.,Female
Really bad experience. Will not go into detail but she should not be in medicine.,Female
"Dr. Saad is sadly inept.  She does not put her patients first.  She is narcissistic.  She asked me how I was doing, when I proceeded to tell her I was upset with her and how she handled renewing a Rx I have been on for 10 years, she  responded not with words, but by walking out of the treating room!  I followed her out, and she said I needed to find a ""new doctor.""  She did me a favar, actually.  Judging by reviews, I am not the only person she has fallen way short of taking care of medically.",Female
"Saw her a couple of months ago.  Found her to be very standoffish and not very concerned with being responsive to her patient needs.  When I need a prescription refilled,  I feel as if I am bothering her.  My  emails are never answered or addressed in a timely manner if at all.  My doctor before her was very responsive and efficient.  I have decided to see someone with more experience, more responsive and takes patient care more seriously.  ",Female
"I saw Dr Moizah Saad the other day and was very impressed.  She was easy to talk to, asked the right questions, and had good follow through with the different tests she ordered.   She called me back with the results and even helped me to get an early appointment with a specialist that I needed to see.  I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a primary card physician.",Female
"I thought she was thorough, caring and focused. I threw a lot of stuff at her at our first visit and she jumped right on ordering tests, referring to specialists and fact gathering from all my information. Since it is the beginning of our relationship I am still learning but what a relief after my previous PCP. I also liked her office staff, they knew I was having difficulty and helped me to kindly problem solve my situation and get in to see her. Very happy with them!",Female
I am moving on to someone who will take their time with patients and who has more experience.,Female
"One of the very few doctors I have seen in my life that will make you feel how much you care about you and your health.
You can feel as if there is nothing else in the world but you to care for.  Takes all the time needed, explains and demonstrates her knowledge and educate you.
Will not rush to treating the symptoms but rather to search for the cause and help you in the same way you would help your self if you have her skills.
Can not say enough, I am lucky I chose her as my PCP",Female

"I told her something was wrong with my 2 week old. She said it was colic and to just learn to live with it. I used google and trial and error to figure out, after suffering the next six weeks, that she had an allergy to fenugreek in my breastmilk- it was taken per Dr. Saad's recommendation. Worst doctor I've seen and unfortunately my daughter suffered the consequences.",Female
Dr. Saad is the BEST! She has been like a second mother to my children. She is careful and does not rush through her examinations. When necessary she refers to quality specialists.

Very patient with patients ,Male
"Even though he was unable to help me with my back pain because I have health conditions that limit my treatment to medications only, he was the first to make the sudden and debilitating pains in my legs go away.

I needed long term pain management with strong pain medications that he did not feel comfortable with.  If it wasn't for my health issues I am certain he could have ended my back pain as well.  

He is very polite and explains everything well.",Male
"I admire Dr Saad and his staff, who have helped me a lot with a painful, ongoing skin condition.  Not only was I in serious pain,but feeling defeated. I was put at ease during my first visit.

"Been trying for over a year to know what's wrong with my stomach. No doctor figured it out. At a last ditch effort, I drove to the other side of the state for help. In one visit, I knew more than a year with local doctors. Further specialists brought in by Dr. Saad, and took away some scripts, not drug me with narcotics and not know what's really wrong.

"Dr Saad was very kind, listened to me and answered all my questions.",Female
I would not let this doctor take care of my DOG! My 3 yr old daughter went to the ER for a laceration on her finger &amp; face. He was not gentle with my daughter at all! We did as we were told-we took the bandage off at home to clean the wound &amp; redress. He MISSED a large laceration on the bottom of her finger which required another ER visit that night &amp; my daughter being re-sedated! This was the sorriest care EVER! We will NOT return to WakeMed Ped ER again! He should NOT be allowed to practice!!!,Male
"Dr SaaS is your typical condescending, uncaring, your not worth his time doctor. He doesnt listen to any symptoms and assumes of you are a first time parents you don't know your kid was upset due to gas. Gas? I know my baby and my baby has never been inconsolable in his 3+ months of life nor has his legs ever swell up and turn red trouble breathing and a wheeze. So don't ignore the symptoms I presented to you and tell me he had gas. Your irresponsible and shouldn't work with kids.",Male
I was extremely disappointed.  I have been taking meds for Parkinsons for 15 years and I have had the best Neurologist out of the Barrows Neurological Clinic inPhoenix.  I was brought in by ambulance for losing feeling in left leg and arm.  Dr Saad would not let me take my Parkinsons meds.  I missed 3 doses.  I was panicked which brought my already high blood pressure up even higher.  There are no Neurologists in our area so the hospital the teleprompter was used and MRI ordered.,Male

"Dr. Saad saved my life. I figure that this is the best way to start this review, considering that the only reason that I'm sitting here writing it, is because of him. When I was brought into Northridge Hospital's trauma center, I was in bad shape. I guess you could say that I was in really bad shape, because my heart stopped, and I died on that operating table. Hospital policy states that medical personnel is supposed to work on an unresponsive patient for 6 minutes, and if nothing happens, they call it, and it's game over. Fortunately, for me, Dr. Saad isn't a clock watcher. Instead of giving up after 6 minutes, Dr. Saad spent over 15 minutes, manually squeezing my heart, keeping blood flowing to my brain, and I truly believe that if I was under the care of any other Doctor, I would not be here, writing this review. I will get to see my daughter graduate college and get married, because of what Dr. Saad did for me, and I will be forever grateful that he went the extra mile for me.",Male

"I had tried the C-PAC and found it to be unbearable and leaving my mouth and throat extremely dry.. So dry in fact that it would wake me up and was very troublesome for me.. What impressed me about Dr. Saad, is that when I refused to continue tolerating the C-PAC equipment, he very kindly advised me of his concern, and the danger to my health without the equipment. He advised me that I ought to allow him to at least have me try the air compressor and that it was better than nothing.. It worked!!",Male

EXCELLANT Very good Dr.!,Male
He is a very smart man . I trust his decisions for my health. He is very kind.  I feel at that the staff needs to respect patients privacy. Like listening to patients questions on the speaker phone.

He ran test after test and by Saturday at 9:30 PM he called to say that they had found Lymn Disease signs in my spinal fluid.  He was on my case hour after hour. He prescribed antibiotics.

Because I have chronic upper-respitory issues, Dr. Saadat wanted to make sure the surgeon was especially aware of my condition, so he personally called the surgeon, explained my situation, and asked him to take caution during surgery. Even the surgeon was surprised by the personal touch. ",Male

Because of some hearing loss which I have recently suffered, I am having a great deal of trouble understanding anyone who speaks with an accent.  I was pleased to find that the only accent he spoke with was that of a Southern-Californian.  An excellent communicator, both he and his staff are friendly, efficient and detail oriented.

I came to Los Angeles and I've been highly recommended to meet him to explain him my problem. I was literally living with chronical pain and couldn't stand up more than 5min without that horrible sciatica pain going from my back to my foot. I can frankly say that meeting him was the best decision I have ever made! First of all Dr Saadat, is the most pleasant surgeon I ve met so far ( and I met a lot of them), he is friendly with a very caring attitude, he has also been able to answer all the questions I had. And above all, I am finally pain free after years of daily pain!

Everything went great. Dr Saadat made me feel comfortable with the decision to have surgery. No pain since surgery.",Male
"After having 2 back surgeries, Dr. Saadat was recommended to me by a friend. After meeting with Dr. Saadat he was very thorough and professional compared to the other Doctors. He came up with the best plan to get me back to a pain free life! After the surgery, he was at the Hospital to check on me every Day, and even came in on Easter Sunday. I would highly recommend Dr. Saadat. He is very reliable. First Dr. to give me his cell phone number telling me to call Him if I need anything.",Male
"I had disc disease pluse  a vertebra was off to one side on a nerve and a cyst was on another. I was in real pain for 8 months, it took my life from me. I could only sit on my bed, everything else hurt. I had several dr.s say it was age, just live with it. None suggested a surgen. Then I found Dr. Saadat. His confidence, professionalism, and willingness to answer any  question immediately put my fears to rest. I am 4 weeks post OP and recovered 70%. Thank you Dr. for giving me my life back.",Male
"Dr Saadat is a PRIME EXAMPLE of an EXCELLENT Doctor ! I had a laminoplasty back in December of 2017. Right away when I met him, I knew I could trust him, which was extremely important to me. He explained my procedure in detail &amp; made me feel at ease about my decision to have the surgery. I was in excruciating pain before the surgery, &amp; now 7 months post opt, with therapy...I’m feeling way better than I ever expected. If you are considering having an laminoplasty, Dr Saadat is your choice!!",Male
I was suffering from spinal stenosis for years.  My pain would go down my legs and feet and would get numb.  I was sent to Dr. Saadat for evaluation.  He suggested I get a back surgery.  I was very scarred because people I new who had that surgery were not doing well after surgery.  I decided to have the surgery by Dr. Saadat.  I am now 3 months post-op and I feel very well.  I do not have pain anymore and returned to work and doing excellent.  Dr. Saadat is very good and caring. I recommend him,Male
Dr. Saadat was assigned to me when I needed emergency surgery on my left femur after a bicycle accident.  I was not given a choice of physicians because I was in an unfamiliary hospital and could not reach out to my regular doctor for a surgical referral.  I was glad it worked out as it did.  Dr. Saadat did a great job inserting a titanium rod tied to my hip and has followed up in a caring way throughout the healing process.  I would say that his expertise and bedside manner have both been great,Male
"After dealing with unbearable sciatica nerve pain for for more than 6 months, and having gone through countless sessions of chiropractic care, acupuncturist, and cortisone shots in the spine, dr Saadat was able to go in with a microscope and perform a successful microdiscectomy. I am now pain free, and even though I’m still recovering, cause it’s only been 4 weeks, it feels good being able to participate in my kids daily routine.",Male
"I have suffered with spinal stenosis &amp; degenerative disk disease for 32 years. in the mid 1990s I had two lumbar laminectomies that were moderately successful. In 2017 my condition suddenly worsened. A renowned neuro-surgeon told me that corrective surgery was too risky and referred me to Dr Saadat. On my first visit with Dr Saadat, I knew that I had the right doctor. He immediately filled me with hope. He expedited a surgery date. I am 3 weeks post-surgery and have no pain. WONDERFUL DOCTOR!!",Male
Dr. Saadat has been my Dr. for about 10+ years.  He is professional and attentive you are not just a number to him he genuinely cares for his patience.  i highly recommend this Dr. you can trust him he will do whats best for your health needs .,Male
I have been going to Dr Saadat for about 2 years.  He is a caring physician and the staff is friendly and accommodating.  I never have to wait long in the waiting room and he has a good bedside manner.  It is somewhat difficult to get a last minute appointment though if you call when they first come in they will do their best to get you in.,Male
Always helpful happy and show they really care about their patients,Male
Took all 3 of my boys for a well check today and although it did take a little while they were very thorough and very polite and nice. I loved dr.saadat and I’m so glad tht she is gonna be my boys dr now. She’s a very caring and sweet dr.,Female
Dr. Saadat is great with those babies!! Our girls love her...its a longer wait but its worth it she takes her time with each child and is checks everything! Oh and Nurse Jackie is the sweetest ever!!,Female
"Dr Saadat is WONDERFUL great personality compassionate and caring , his level of experience and quality of care couldn't be better. His physician assistant is also good. His office staff sucks.they usually can't answer simple questions while you are there and they NEVER answer the phone and only occasionally return calls",Male
"Dr. Saadat is a very caring, capable, personable   and compassionate  Dr.  I would trust him with my life.... as a matter of fact I did and here I still am ...…  I would give him 100 stars",Male
"The doctor and nurse practitioner at this office are amazing the rest of the staff, however, ruin it for me! 
Unprofessional, refuse to answer phone calls but make time for 2-3 smoke breaks in a half hour period, called to cancel and appointment with no answer... continued to call 25!! Times in one day with no answer and no returned call. 

Do yourselves a favor and get rid of the front desk/nurses you staff! They are horrible!",Male
"Great doctor. Listens well. Very informative. Office staff is great.
",Male
Dr. Sadaat and his staff are excellent ,Male
"Other than the long wait, Dr. Saadat is exceptional.  Answered all questions and took care of my Mohs procedure efficiently and painlessly.",Male
"I found Dr. Saadat to be extremely rude and arrogant. I have had several basal cells removed by another doctor with little scarring. Dr. Saadat performed his slash and burn technique on a basal cell on my back and it left a big scar. He dismissed and scoffed at my questions about perhaps using a different technique like my previous doctor had used. He also dismissed my suggestion to use a cream to remove a keratosis from my forehead and wanted to cut that off too. I insisted on the cream, which 100% got rid of the keratosis with zero scarring. He is obviously just trying to suggest easy money making procedures for himself. He is the worst doctor I have gone to in the last 30 years. I will never go to him again.",Male
I love Dr. Saadat.  He refuses to do to much and makes me long younger every year.,Male
Was very patient in discussing my options for acne treatment and explaining after care plan. Would highly recommend!,Male

He never rushes me...listens to my concerns.  Went to see him recently and thanks to his recommendation I am better.",Male
"Was referred by oncology to surgeon Dr Saadat on a subject of lipomas and problems with left shoulder.  Surgery was not necessary, exam and explanations were excellent.  But most important Dr. Saadat referred me to the right specialist.  ",Male
"Dr Saadat was confusing during the procedure. He told me I would have no pain. A week later I was swollen, couldn't walk and had a severe infection from the poor procedure or micro dermal piercing removal. When I tried to contact him he wouldn't talk to me and said it looked normal. I ended up with a massive infection and admittance into the hospital. ",Male
"Rushed our visit, gave a diagnosis without hardly looking at my skin or asking me any questions. Prescribed an absurdly expensive pair of lotions that had absolutely no effect. Waste of time and money.",Male
"It was my first and last visit. Very rude and unprofessional. Worst doctor i have seen in my life. ""Dr"" Saadat didn't want to listen and acted like he was in rush.  I think he hates his job. Anyways, I don't recommend this person to anyone. Found another dermatologist and I am so much happier.",Male
I have followed Dr. Saadat from Keck Medical School at USC school of medicine. The reason that I followed him was because of his manners and patients since I have had psoriasis since birth and my adult life.  He has and now keeping me in a clear condition.,Male
The worse doctor.  Takes advantage of patients.  Procedure cost more than the doctor told me it would (thousands more).  I had to do a payment plan and when they forgot to send me a bill they decided to take it a collection agency.  Very shady doctor with bad business practices.,Male
The worst doctor on the planet,Male
"I had a surgery in 2013 but not results,, everytime I  get pregnant in the week 7 i got a pain in the surgery part and I lost the pregnancy so NOT good after a surgery he suppose to tell me what to do about vitamins or treatments  to get a great pregnancy he never said something",Male
Dr. Saadat made my husband and my dream come true again in 2003 I made the decision to get my tubes cut. I regret it after and in 2017 I found Dr. Saadat through a friend. My husband and I decided to give it a try and I got a tubal reversal in 2017. And thanks to Dr. Saadat I now have a 2 week old baby boy. It took longer but because I was under a lot of stress at work. But my surgery was a success and Dr. Saadat was great really nice doctor. Thank you doctor.,Male
"I came to Dr. Saadat thanks to all the good reviews across different forums, and decided to do an IVF cycle with him because he seemed very calm, nice and confident. Unfortunately, with $18,800 ivf fee + ~$6000 meds, he was able to retrieve only 4 eggs. And these 4 eggs across all stages, 1 was overmature, 1 was undermature, and 2 were mature. The worst thing was that the only fertilized one arrested on day 3. So, I got nothing!!!!!When I asked, all he did was to suggest another cycle. A couple of months later, I went to Life IVF. For less than half the cost, I had two mini ivf cycles, retrieved 20 eggs and freezed 8 blasts. Dr. Saadat must give me too much meds. Plus, his financial department was very very hard to deal with, they did not stand by their words and treated you like second class once you paid.",Male
"I am 44 years old and ready to have my baby in just a few days! Yes I made it to full term with out complications. Dr Saadat was so thorough and found out why I was not holding pregnancies. I kept having early miscarriages. He was not about how much money he could make off me, he solved the problem and the next month I was pregnant on my own! No need for expensive procedures! Thank you Dr Saadat! My first and only son is on his way! By the looks of his 4D US he is gorgeous!",Male
Had a great experience and have a healthy baby! Will be going back next year!  Thank you Dr Saadat??????,Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. Saadat's for 3years. He and his team strive for excellence in customer service. Their compassion and understanding is highly commendable as they go over and above to accommodate their patients.  The journey alone is extremely emotional and Dr. Saadat and his team do not give up hope. After five cycles, I'm overjoyed to share I'm five months pregnant with a little girl. Thank you  to Dr. Saadat, Lizette, Anna, Melissa, Xochitl, Liz, and Jen.",Male
"I regret choosing Dr. Saadat tremendesly! If I could do it all over again I would of choosen Dr. Surrey to do IVF rather than tibial reversal with Saadat. Every time I came to his office it seemed I paid more and more money... his procedure did not work either , I had not conceived once. The worst part was 3 days post op I was bleeding horribly &amp; had lower abdomen pain, I called the office &amp; spoke with saadat, he gave brief medical opinion and said if I had $250 he would do a consolation !",Male
He is the best Dr ever I have seen ,Male
"We chose Dr. Saadat after interviewing a few other fertility physician. We couldn’t be more happier with our choice. Dr. Saadat has been extremely professional and patient with us, guiding us through the process and answering all our questions. My wife got pregnant on our first IVF cycle with two twin babies, and we are grateful for the excellent service by Dr. Peyman Saadat. If I could give more than FIVE stars for their service, I would love to!",Male
Dr. Peyman Saadat was very helpful. He and his staff were there to answer any questions we had. They were prompt on their responses as well as very friendly. We wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't for him and his staff. I would definitely recommend him if you are looking to get a chance to become parents.,Male
"We had a long journey to where we are now. After few years of trying and going to different fertility doctors, we finally were able to find Dr. Saadat and we got pregnant. We're so happy.  Wish we found Dr. Saadat sooner.  I hope he will be able to help more people",Male
"We love Dr. Saadat, he is so kind and patient with us.. answering all our questions and found the best treatment for us. We're so happy to have our baby girl. Dr. Saadat is truly wonderful.",Male
"This was my first and final visit to this doctor! I had strep throat. The dr prescribed an antibiotic that I was allergic to, and when I try to tell them that, they tell me that it’s a good antibiotic, and I should try it again. Really?!  I had to go to the ER to get an antibiotic I could actually take! Floyd county has the WORST doctors ever! I am NEVER going to this IDIOT again! I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone!",Male
"After over 15 years of dealing with ""out of control hypertension"" and taking the highest dosages possible of blood pressure meds permissible by my having just one kidney, I saw Dr. Saadat who asked to check my endocrine gland.  Turns out that was the culprit of my high blood pressure and now I am off all blood pressure meds.  I cannot thank this doctor enough.  He is an EXCELLENT doctor.",Male
"Very thorough. Did not rush to get through the appointment like most doctors do. He allowed me to ask as many questions as I wanted and willingly answered my questions, making sure I understood everything.  I would highly recommend Dr. Saadat! ",Male
Wonderful! She is by far the best!,Female
"She is the most caring as well as competent physician who really tries to help her patients.  Answers all questions, never rushes you.   I just love her.",Female

"A very kind gentleman. Concern for his patients is evident.
He is a smart compassionate man. Lucky and so appreciative 
Of his talents. Very grateful to have him as my doc.",Male
"The front office staff are very unprofessional. Felicia can be very condescending and even laugh while she's trying to explain things to you, as if you're an idiot. I wouldn't recommend going to this office to anyway, especially if you would like to be treated with dignity and respect.  The doctor doesn't even explain your condition to you. He asks you how you're feeling and writes a script. ",Male
"Best doctor ever!!!!  My 16 year old son really liked Dr. Saade.  Dr. Saade was wonderful, he's extremely easy to talk to, put my son at ease, listened patiently, was knowledgeable and provided valuable advice.  The staff is equally as wonderful and a pleasure to work with.  Highly recommend Dr. Saade and the whole practice.",Male
My child has a 7 month delay that was not caught by Dr. Saade. We presented him with many red flags and he told us our daughter would be fine. This practice was not a good fit for our family.,Male
"Dr. Saade does not offer individualized health care for his patients. He wants it his way, and cares more that you adhere to his preferences than making informed decisions and what you as a parent is in the best interest of your child. Very disappointed. ",Male
"I would definitely recommend Dr. Saade. Very informative, patient with kids, and over all a great doctor! Glad to have him as our pediatrician. CF",Male
"Kind and calm, explains everything in a way we can understand. She listens and answers all of our questions.",Female
Dr. Theodore by far is one of the most caring and professional medical providers I've ever encountered. Coming from the medical field myself we tend to be very critical of our own industry so my 5 Star rating speaks for itself. Dr. Theodore is amazing and her love of the field shows in her compassion. You couldn't ask for a better Ophthalmologist.,Female
"Dr. Theodore was excellent in her bedside manner. She was very knowlegable, thourough and   extra cautious about patient safety. She also let me view the results of eye exam on computer and explained things very well.",Female
Hurts to have a cigarette and they will try to diagnose you over the phone I had a lady dismiss my preeclampsia symptoms with Dr. topping out the office she basically told me to get over it unless it’s over 140 it was 137 at the time three hours later it spiked to 157/112 and it was already too late to have a ride to the hospital I really hope my baby is OK and I wish her staff with would be NICER and enjoy picking up the phone I’m not trying to rush you off and lie that there’s no one going to be in the office for three days straight,Female
"Dr. Ta was very insensitive and unprofessional. She treated my questions as if they were dumb and treated me as a child, she was rushed to get me out of the office and was not caring about my health. I had many health concerns that were not addressed. The nurses were very friendly and comforting. I felt uncomfortable in the care of dr. Ta. No bedside manners.",Female
"Dr. Ta is one of those rare doctors that really cares about her patients. She really listens, she asks questions, she works through all of your issues and concerns with tact and compassion. Her staff is beyond compare! They go out of their way to put you at ease and make difficult situations as comfortable as possible. No one hurries you, no one dismisses your concerns, there is no condescension as with many doctors. I would never go to another gynecologist.",Female
Dr Ta is so patient and kind. My daughter has gone to him for years. He is gentle and truly cares about his patients.,Male
"We have been with Dr Ta for over 5 year. He is very caring and takes a good amount of time with me. We very seldom wait more than a few minutes. The staff is excellent. All around a GREAT experience.

Amazing doctor,Female

"I started having eye issues 2 years ago and my ophthalmologist recommended Dr. Kathy Ta for a deeper look into my eyes. (First note, I saw a Neurologist/Ophthalmologist who thought my eyes were just a vertigo issue. He was incorrect in his assumption without doing any testing.) 
Dr. Ta did extensive testing and with dye saw that my eyes were leaking along the eye vein wall and classified me as having ""Intermediate Uveitis Vitreous."" This was very serious and she immediately started me on steroids to allay the condition. She also contacted a Neurologist and Rheumatologist, to do further testing and additional medication, believing it to be an auto-immune condition. She calms my concerns over possibly loosing my eyesight and stays up-to-date with the latest prescriptions and procedures. Because she is that good and she shows concern for all her patients, be prepared to wait a little.  For me, she is worth the time. Great doctor!",Female
Highly recommended. Good doctor if you can be patient and hang in there. He is very kind understanding and always gives helpful advice. Takes care of both mental and physical aspect of his patients.,Male
"Dr Kent Ta is kind,caring and polite. He is helping me recover by working with East side Therapy in Redwood and aquatic therapy on Mercer island.
Thank you for believing in me Dr Ta",Male
"I completely disagree with the negative reviews I see posted. I was referred to Dr Ta by a friend who has been a patient of his for many years now. Not only has Dr Ta helped relieve my symptoms with RA, but him and his staff are wonderful! I always meet with his assistant before the doctor comes into the room and she is extremely polite and accommodating to any needs I may have. 
I would absolutely recommend this physician to anyone who is truly looking for the best care around",Male
"It’s impossible to rate a doctor without factoring in the office staff. The front desk is always rude and dismissive which is especially important due to the fact that the people they are dealing with on a daily basis are in pain. And his assistant does not return calls which again is a problem due to the nature of his practice. 
I think if Dr Ta really cares, especially since he asked me to post a review after the first visit, he would read these reviews and fix the problems with his staff. ",Male
"I’ve had hip pain since I was 18 and was told by my first rumatologist that i had early osteoarthritis of the hip. Besides physical therapy and cortisone shots I would eventually need a hip replacement. Hearing that in my mid 20’s was frightening and extremely concerning, especially since the underlying issue was a mystery. I got a second opinion from Dr Ta who diagnosed me with idiopathic hip chondrolysis. The only con a I have for him is his office staff. They don’t return phone calls",Male
Dr. Ta and his staff have been amazing with the care of my 83 year old mother.  They have treated us with care and compassion.   Dr. Ta has gone above and beyond to provide the best medical care for my mom.  I would recommend Dr. Ta and his staff to anyone who is looking for an Internal Medicine Physician.  He is the BEST!!!  Sandee Davis,Male
"I'm so grateful to have found Dr. Ta. My previous rheumatologist was dismissive of my symptoms and seemed to have run out of ideas for treatment. From my first visit with Dr. Ta, I felt confident that he would persist in finding the right treatment for my disease...and he has! Dr. Ta is both kind and direct in his communications. He listens to me, respects my ideas, and makes me feel like a partner in managing my care. His infusion nurse Keri is terrific! Trust is everything when you're sick!",Male
"Wouldn't recommend my friends to Dr.Ta.
- Did take much interest in my problem
- Could not/did not find the issue.
- Did not offer any solution short or long term
- When i asked for medication/pain relief, he suggested a shot, that he said may or may not work. Did not guide me on what to do if it did not work.
- When I visited again for acute pain, he got me a shot in the office - but he didn't want to give me the shot - he acted as if it was BENEATH him to give me a shot.
- Wait times &gt; 1 hr",Male
"Dr. Ta was the first rheumatologist to take my symptoms and tests seriously. As a mid 20s ""alternative-looking"" girl, I had gone through a few doctors at that point for ""invisible"" joint pain. Dr. Ta saw my blood tests and approached my joint issues professionally and thoroughly. Now, approaching 30, my tests and doctors have confirmed a diagnosis of RA. 

I truly believe that Dr. Ta helped me to reach my diagnosis; a mystery for 12 years. He always treated like a person with valid concerns.",Male
"Dr. Ta has been my rheumatologist for probably ten years.  He has been an outstanding physician, in that he listens attentively, gives much thought to my symptoms, and adjusts my medication always to appropriate levels. He is one of the kindest and most caring persons I have ever known.  I am most grateful to have him as one of my most valued doctors.    ",Male
"Dr Ta seems very knowledgeable.    Don't expect detailed answers because of the language difference.

Unfortunately for him, the staff reflect very poorly on him.

The office staff seem miserable.   They don't return calls or seem to give a crap about their customers.  Seriously.   They are the worst. 
",Male
I have been seeing Dr. Ta for the last 2 years and I am very happy with his service.  He is very thoughtful and understanding and has worked with me to go over all of my (limited) options to find the best quality of life.  It's great to have a doctor that actual listens to what you say and values your input.  He always goes out of his way to answer any and all of my questions.  I look forward to my appointments with him which is saying a lot.  He's a great doctor and highly recommend him to all.,Male
"Dr Ta is kind, gentle, non-judgemenal  and thorough. He will try many options to help you feel better. He helps you find the medications that work for you. I can finally sleep at night. NO ONE GIVES A BETTER CORTISONE INJECTION -  shoulders/knees etc. you don't even feel it. I'm so glad I found Dr Ta to help me with my arthritis issues. I was",Male
I have been seeing Dr Ta for 3 years. Dr. Ta provides very thoughtful and considerate care. He listens well. They have in-office lab services too which is so very convenient.,Male
"I was diagnosed with JRA at age 16 and have been dealing with joint pain and inflammation for years. I went to see Dr Ta to find out if my diagnosis might have changed and for relief of my symptoms. X-rays were taken and blood was drawn. I tested positive for a specific gene which caused Dr Ta to request more bloodwork however 3 visits later I still did not have a diagnosis nor could he explain my symptoms but he wanted to start me on Humira injections! Also, the office staff weren't friendly.",Male
"Dr. Ta is pleasant, punctual, and exceptionally knowledgeable. He diagnosed and treated my inflammatory arthritis for several years, and he made the best possible call regarding three different injuries I sustained at work and at home. His inclination is to be conservative toward surgery, preferring to avoid it when possible, and he is both compassionate and effective in dealing with chronic pain. He even diagnosed and referred me for other complaints not related to rheumatology. Outstanding.",Male
"Dr. Ta is kind, soft spoken, competent, and thorough.  His course of treatment has been fantastic and I'm feeling better than I have in a long time.  Dr. Ta's care has made the 
drive from Puyallup worth the time and effort.  I'm thankful for his care and appreciate
all he has done for me.",Male
"Dr. Ta is kind, compassionate, and takes his time. Doc Ta explains everything in detail. Listens and includes my input on my health issues.  Doc Ta includes me in my treatment plan as though I was his peer.  He has mad patience and shows what a great doctor can be. Thanks to Doc Ta and all great office staff.",Male
"The doctor himself was nice, but the office staff were horrible.",Male
I was very impressed with Dr.Ta! He took time to explain everything to me (no rush). I would most certainly recommend him. I know I will get very good care. Rita Taylor.,Male
She’s a very great OB!!,Female
I have been a patient of Dr. Ta's for over 3 years. My insurance company showed she had 5 stars so I believe I found the best. She is amazing and patient. She listens to all your concerns and explains her answers in detail and very straight forward. Dr. Ta is very professional. She handled my miscarriage and the birth of my daughter. A patient can have issues with the office however; for me the professionalism and integrity of the doctor is what is most important and Dr. Ta exudes just that. I believe you have to have a good doctor to handle all the hormonal changes and emotions a pregnant woman can have.,Female
"If I could give Dr. Ta and her staff 0 stars I would. VERY rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional. When we decided to switch OB's (Beginning of our pregnancy) and had her office fax over all my paperwork to my new OB. One of the staff members wrote things like ""Patient was very rude, husband is terrible"" etc.... ummm HIPPA? My new OB told me someone wrote all of those things in my file. AWFUL! Not the place to go. If you would like an amazing OBGYN go to DR. SIDRA YUNAS SHE IS AWESOME IN EVERY WAY!",Female
I’ve been coming to Dr. Ta since she delivered my baby 10 years ago and she is always amazing. Her bedside manner is great and she takes her time answering all of my questions and addressing my concerns.,Female
I am a new patient to Dr. Ta.  She was recommended to me by my coworkers.  She took her time to listen to me and explained my condition in a way that I could understand.  I have never had this explained to me by any other gynecologist.  She made my first visit with her very comfortable!  Will recommend her to all who needs an Ob/Gyn.,Female
Dr TAs will charge you tremendous amounts after the procedure. Even insurance company stated they charge twice or 3 times again for the same things. Completely irresponsible and They keep sening bills bills bills for thousand of dollars. Keep away from her office and find better medical assistance. She is been nightmare and we going to sue her office for fraudulent bills They keep sending!!!,Female
"I used to love this OB-GYN office and referred anyone new in town or looking to make a change to visit them. From the beginning, I liked the brevity of appointments and having a comprehensive exam that I didn't need to devote more time to than necessary. However, I've become increasingly frustrated with Dr. Ta and her ability to take issues seriously/spend more than a few minutes during a $100+ appointment. I was having serious medical issues that I brought to her attention hoping for some guida",Female
Horrible customer service calling to see what insurances this Dr accepts and the whole time the person was rude and never helped me out would not go here!,Female
"Dr Minh Ta is sincere, empathetic and very personable. he made me feel very comfortable within 30 seconds of meeting him. I have seen a dozen doctors at Inova over the years and he is by far the best one i ever had. i really hope Inova can keep him!",Male
Dr Ta was very friendly and genuine.. he seemed to really care about my health,Male
"I highly recommend Dr. Ta, he is very knowledgeable and calm.",Male
"Approachable, personable and knowledgeable.  Takes time in an exam to listen to patient and discuss treatment options with patient.   ",Male
Best bedside manner. Most caring and professional ,Female
I have to say Dr. Ta is one of the best doctors I have seen. I'm originally a Kaiser member and I had second thoughts on any other private doctors. After seeing Dr.Ta I'm confident in my treatment plan and will recommend her on the highest scale. She takes what ever time is needed to answer your questions and treat your condition.,Female
AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH DR. TA!!! VERY RUDE AND A LIAR!!!,Female
"Very capable dr with great treatment skills.  Very kind too.  I have great confidence in her.  But sure your PCP knows all your drug allergies and drug intolerances.  And foods that cause big problems.  

",Female
"I came in for a flu shot like many of us do. I was also dealing with something else, Dr Ta immediately said let's have a look. She addressed two problems in 20 min. The care she gives to her patients is far better than what I have ever seen. When I call or come in I am always treated as if I were family. That's why I chose her as my PCP.

Dr. Ta is very Caring and understanding. I have been his patient for 6 years and overall I feel he truly takes his job seriously. He gives me the best options that will benefit me and my babies.,Male
"Dr. Ta was my physician for many years and is an EXCELLENT doctor.   He never rushes our appointments, he is very pragmatic and cares about my health and well being while fully respecting my lifestyle choices.  I highly recommend Dr. Ta.",Male
"Dr Ta has misdiagnosed skin cancer on a few patients and they have been referred by his NPs instead. He guess a lot and then when his staff does a better job he makes them feel inferior. He is arrogant and awful to his staff which is why it reflects onto the way they treat their patients when they come in. He is only there twice a week and always guesses symptoms and never allows his NPs to do their job such as referring patients to specialist. If you do he says, ""Oh that costs money."" He claims he has gone to UCLA and did a dermatology rotation but I am sorry he knows nothing. He makes his support staff feel awful and fires them on the spot without really any given notice for simple reasons such as calling in sick when their child is sick. He's an awful boss and doctor. I really do not recommend.",Male
I been his patient for more than 8 years.,Male
"Any Dr that ""guesses"" at your symptons should not even accept new patients!!!  Getting an apt to see him is like pulling teeth, appts are always weeks out and he only sees patients 2 days a week.  You can see a PA when he is not available.  However, there are times when its important that I see him!!!  He has ""guessed"" at a couple of my symptoms and has been way off base causing my symptoms to get worse.  I would not recommend  him to ANYONE!!!!  There are a lot better doctors out there.",Male
"Horrible practitioner!!!
Should not be treating patients!!!!
Misdiagnosed, does not listen to patient!!!!
You don’t wear a mask when you see patients????
You are a physician and you go into a room with an elderly person!!

Shame on you!!!",Male
"My husband and I both see Dr. Taagen.  We have been seeing him for approximately  15 years. He has been excellent.  He asked us plenty of questions and always make us feel that he cares.
Sharron Coleman and John Vitek.",Male
"Dr Taagen was my PCP for 10 years. He is extremely smart and a great lateral thinker. Great listener, has a strong opinion as well - hard to find in the same doctor. For example, he advised me to get a colonoscopy at 47 - a bit earlier than traditional medical practice dictates (newer research says to do earlier) recommends but he derived that opinion based on some symptoms we discussed in a visit. The colonoscopy caught a number of benign polyps that may have been real issues at 50 when many of the books say to get it done. You will be no better hands.",Male
"Very patient, detailed and thorough.",Male
"If there was a Internal Medicine PCP better than Dr. Taagen they would have wings . Has been my trusted Dr, / friend for many years . ",Male
I thought he was an awesome doctor and I felt very comfortable with him.,Male
"I was in the hospital 5 days and had 2 surgeries because I had broken all 3 bones in my ankle and 1 in my arm. My surgeon said I would go home Monday (6th day). Dr Taarea rushed into my room Sunday morning &amp; said I would be going home that morning. I was shocked because the caseworker had never been in to arrange for A wheelchair, bedside toilet, Home Health, physical therapy, or any other accommodations I needed. ( I am 70 &amp; live alone). I couldn’t put any weight at all on my foot or arm. I told Dr. Taarea that my doctor said I would go home the next day, but she said she would make it happen &amp; she certainly did. I felt like I was thrown out of the hospital totally unprepared.  A caseworker finally called me &amp; she was shocked also. She had been told I was going home Monday.   I was in severe pain &amp; felt I was going home unprepared.  This happened in July. I’ve waited 4 mo to write this because I have never written a bad review before.  She was insensitive &amp; unkind to me.",Female
"Nice guy but not a very through doctor and careless staff.  I will not go back.
Nurse put the BP cuff on me as I came in the room and sat down.  While still asking me questions and not fully seated the automated BP cuff starts inflating and she proceeds to ""take"" my BP while still asking questions and not ensuring I am properly positioned.  Of course the results were way off my normal.  I said something to here and she said it was ok they weren't too high (14x/90x vs my normal 110/70).  I asked that they be re-run and she refused.  The doctor says it doesn't matter either!   We go over my history and a very basic physical, then he sends me for blood work saying that fasting isn't needed.   The Total Cholesterol comes back slightly over 200 and I get a call a few days later that my medication in in.  If find out Dr. Taarea has ordered a statin without contacting me to discuss it!  And we had discussed my preference to do self care for other issues!!!  Not what I thought a DO was about.",Male

I called Dr Taba because I was seeing flashing lights. It was during the day on a weekday. I was an established patient but she did not return my call. The next day I called and found she did not have an answering service.  If this were a retinal detachment I certainly would need a doctor who answers the phone,Female
"If you are considering Dr. Katia Taba of  Personalized Retina Care of Naples, I would 100% endorse your decision. Dr. Taba is better than the best, she takes time with each patient, explains everything completely in terms you will understand, and prescribes the best approach to help you in having the best vision that is possible for you. She is a caring, sharing, patient, thoughtful, kind person that is fully interested in you as a patient. 

My wife has had many eye problems and surgeries and absolutely finds Dr. Taba to be the best of the best. In many other eye centers, you get the feeling that it is all about the money and not about the patient. We were so fortunate to find Dr. Taba, and you will feel the same way when you make the decision to have her as your doctor.

"I was so impressed as to how thorough she was on my initial exam, including making referrals to specialists where needed. I felt she was listening, while having throughly reviewed my previous medical chart. Competent, professional yet personable. What was considerably helpful upon completion was a print out of the issues, list of consultants contacted, and plan going forward. Also responds immediately to questions on MyChart. I feel totally confident having Dr. Taba handel my all my health issue",Female
"Terrific family practice physician. Knowledgeable, personable, connects well with people, superb communicator - recommend highly. ",Female
I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. He’s a good doctor. Everything is stressful for him because he’s one for the only doctors. He’s good with his surgical skill. Didn’t work out for me because I didn’t follow everything through so I’ll go to him again. He’s very nice and respectful. I hope he has more doctors to help him.,Male
"I love Dr.Taba! I’ve grown to call him the 3 hour dr because at times I’ve waited that long. It’s worth the wait that’s why I continue to see him. He’s been so helpful with my condition and looking out for my best interests. He truly cares. 
I’ve had doctors with longer than normal wait times before but they are the rudest people I’ve ever encountered and that’s why I choose to wait for Dr.Taba.",Male
"Dr. Taba is an amazing doctor. He is patient, kind, and trustworthy. I trust his judgement about any care given at any time of the day. He answers all the questions attentively and will always show grace and acceptance of anyone. He also teaches me through visual representation of any anatomy model like a knee and muscle model. He is very knowledgeable and very professional about his knowledge of surgical procedures and he invests in the time to get to know the medical history of the patient and the family members. He deserves a 10 plus plus plus rating. I would highly recommend him for anyone else needing to see a Orthopedist surgeon Doctor.",Male
Dr. Taba has preformed 3 separate surgery's on me. I have the utmost respect for him. I would like to see better communication with his nursing staff.,Male
Dr. Taba is a very nice dr who treats you well and listens. He explains every procedure and gives great injections!!   He is very attentive and I would recommend him to everyone. ,Male
"Dr. Taba might be a competent surgeon for the most routine type of orthopedic surgery, but I would not trust his ability to deal with anything difficult.  His typical wait time for an office visit is in excess of FOUR hours.  It is almost unbelievable.  And, I think it is indicative of his entire practice.  Caution.",Male
"I would have to give Dr Taba no stars as he and his office are totally inefficient.   My last appointment in September was at 2:00 pm, I sat for over an hour pass my appointment in the waiting full of people.  I asked how much longer they said just a few more minutes so I continued to wait and was finally called back after waiting 1 hr and 15 minutes in the waiting room.  I thought finally but no I had to wait another 1 hour forThe visit to take less than 15 min.  Not worth the wait!!",Male
Dr Taba is very nice and as of now I will continue to see him with my hip issue but they are extremely busy and seem to be in a rush at all times. The wait time is extremely long and once you actually get to see the dr it is rushed. My issue is the front staff. In person they seem nice but when you have them on the phone it is a constant rush. They don't even let you finish a sentence before they say please hold and transfer you. They cut you off and constantly sound annoyed at you. ,Male
"I write this as I sit in the waiting room 45 minutes past my appointment. The first visit took over 1 1/2 hours to be seen, and we didn't see the Dr. - I was seen by his assistant. They were to call in 2 prescriptions, one which was a day late and the other never happened. Don't bother calling because no one answers - left vm and never heard back. They are very good at remindinding you of your appointment (2 automated and one real person) and for collecting co-pay ( happens before your 1 hr wait",Male
"My son broke his finger and we visited an urgent clinic and used the clinic's referral program because we are new to the DFW area. He and his staff are very nice and friendly, but we waited a LONG time to be seen. Our appointment was at 2:30 pm we arrived at 2 pm, because we knew we were new patients and had to complete paperwork, but we did not leave until almost 5 pm. We had a rushed encounter with Dr. Taba; he seemed knowledgeable, but didn't spend attentive quality time with us.",Male
"My husband got an appointment with Dr Taba ; at that day he was seen by another person ( not sure if she was a doctor or assistant) &amp; he was told doctor had a surgery !so my husband was not seen by Dr Taba &amp;  They charged my insurance for a visit &amp; x-Ray for $150 &amp; my husband still has the same issue he had before !!!
Not satisfied at all with their services ; the receptionist should have told my husband before seeing him ;(
They don't care, they just use your insurance for nothing!",Male
"I don't how my experience would have been after waiting an hour in waiting room.  I checked on how much longer the wait would, since they called a person that arrived thirty minutes after I did.  I was told they were just entering my information and they did not know how much longer it would be. I left since I had taken time off for work.    I am now getting phone calls that I missed my appointment.     ",Male

"I have to describe my experience with Dr. Tabachnick as exceptional! She brought me through a crisis near the end of my surgery that could have taken my life. She replaced my bicuspid aortic valve. I had an aneurysm that burst as she was almost finished closing me and I am here, very much alive and well, to tell you about it. This type of crisis that can occur during surgery is the reason I chose to have my surgery at Baylor Plano Heart Hospital where the doctors have a lot of experience. ",Female
I had a consultation with Dr. Taback. He repeatedly interrupted me when I spoke and didn't answer any of my questions. He was very condescending when he spoke. I did not feel respected by him at all. I would not recommend him.,Male

"Dr. Taback is everything a great doctor should be!  Wonderful manner and ultra pleasant personality.  Everyone in the office is extremely kind and caring--something that is rare to find these days.  I would never hesitate recommending Dr. Taback--and his reputation in the medical community is outstanding.  It is unfair of those who gave poor reviews based on a long wait.  That is not the norm in Dr. Taback's office, and absolutely does not reflect on his reputation or ability as a surgeon.",Male
"I was referred to Dr. Taback to look at a giant lipoma on my thigh.  I was fearful that it could never be safely removed.  Dr. Taback evaluated my situation and reassured me that he could do the surgery.  He was kind, knowledgable, down to earth and had a sense of humor.  Surgery was done with great success and no side effects.  Dr. Taback not only removed the tumor but also removed years of humiliation and embarrassment.  Dr. Taback is humble and cares for his patients.  He is wonderful!",Male
"Dr. Taback was a life saver for me in 2017. I was diagnosed with DCIS and interviewed several breast surgeons and found Dr. Taback to be most attentive and compassionate and has tremendous knowledge of the latest techniques in breast surgery. Dr. Taback did beautiful work in two surgeries, closely tracked me through recovery and when I showed signs of a hospital-borne infection, he stayed involved in the process of getting the infection cleared up. A caring doctor - not easy to find today.",Male
"To say it simply, more than four years ago Dr. Taback saved my life by surgically removing my Category IV, metastatic, inoperable melanoma and by administering the anti-immune treatment called Yervoy. He also took care of the treatment's serious side effects. Today, I am entirely symptom free. Istvan Deak. ",Male
Dr. Taback is the Best Doctor,Male
My children were patients at this practice for 7 years. I was 6 minutes late for one appointment and they cancelled on me. I’ve never had a reason to dislike the doctors at the practice but this policy felt very inconsistent with how I felt they worked and should work. We had not had any prior missed or late appointments and drive 20 minutes to get to their office. Very upsetting when you have a sick kid you need assistance with. We won’t be back.,Female
Dr. Taback is a nice person with a pleasant demeanor. But I've been a patient of his for years and I'm finally frustrated with the fact that he doesn't respect his patients' time and lacks good communication skills (when not in the office for a visit). I have had to wait sometimes for an extra hour to see him when I had an appointment set. Currently I've been going back and forth with his office and Blue Cross and 2 other companies trying to schedule an MRI. The Doctor was supposed to do a peer to peer call with Insurance to explain why I need an MRI. He has failed to do so and now the request for MRI / claim has been closed. I've waited 3 weeks for his office staff to get back to me and nothing. I call back today and they have a weird message on their voicemail like it is a holiday (They reference Dec. 31 - Jan. 1st they will be closed for New Years). It is July 10th! Really??!! So I left a message with the doctor on call as an emergency. No live person or other message system.,Male
"Did not help with my asthma symptoms. Went for a few years with zero results. Did not seem to listen that I was getting no relief from any of the medications and continued to prescribe same ones each time I went back. The most inconsiderate thing was the wait time. Every time I had an appointment, he was running over a hour late and without any apology or consideration for the patient. Would not recommend at all",Male
"He wants to take out my dad’s tube and if needed, then put it back. Based on several SBP tests, my dad can breath on his own for at most 2hours he has the tube for a week. I asked for another day since my nurse sister will be arriving in town. He said he cannot wait and will do it in 30 min but something happened when the nurse and the RT is with my dad and luckily my dad becomes ok and they decided not to take out the tube. Good thing I request that he be replaced is granted.",Male
His office manager Sherri is horrible. We were waiting for our appointment asked to speak with her because the Dr was late and she would not come speak to us so we had to speak up the illiterate receptionist Maria Who just said take it up with the doctor. She was so rude telling us she doesn’t control the doctor. So un helpful ,Male
Dr. Taback has been invaluable in helping me to manage and rule out potential medical issues to reach a proper diagnosis.  Still a diagnosis in process but very much appreciate him teaming up with me and not dismissing symptoms.  ,Male
"He is very caring and knows his stuff. I had a very successful L5S1 surgery with him over 20 years ago. From being bedridden before the surgery to horseback riding, running, dancing and living a normal healthy very active lifestyle six months after surgery. I will always thank him and his nurse Susan for their help.",Male
I would highly recommend Dr. Tabaddor of University of Orthopedics. He is a doctor who listens with compassion. Sept 2018 I had a right hip labrum repair with ipsilateral iliopsoas release. All my life my gait &amp; balance were off in which I only became symptomatic in the last 8yrs which caused a dramatic decline of daily activities &amp; recreation. I experienced excruciating pain while my rip hip would lockup causing me not being able to move.  My iliopsoas was so taunt in my leg it had torn the labrum (cartilage) in my hip causing a flap that would clamp down with the femur head causing the locking up/pain.  My iliopsoas release was not just an adjustment to reduce the pain it caused by tearing my right hip labrum but a life changing procedure. This is issue is common mostly in women &amp; it is an issue that is being studied &amp; needs awareness. There are not many professionals who work in this type of corrective care. He is &amp; my thankfulness &amp; gratitude for this life-changing correction.,Male
"Good bedside manner, quickly diagnosed and started treatment ",Male
"Wonderful physician.  Was able to diagnose labral tears that caused pain and gait changes. Corrected those by surgery allowing me to regain a normal walk pattern.

"I suffered needlessly for 8 months. On crutches and cane.
I was told I had bakers cyst in both knees by Dr T
Finally went to Hartford Ct Dr who drained the cyst and gave me a cortisone shot. Left the office like a new person. No cyst in left as told by Dr T.  Had MRI in Wakefield and requested it sent to Hartford.
They sent a report that stated negative for cyst.  After ultrasound Hartford Dr knew report was bad. Luckily I had the disc which showed the cyst had burst. I wasted pain/money/time",Male

While a patient under him, Dr. Tabaie assured me he was able to do my stenting surgery I needed, and that he was in contact with Stanford throughout my treatment. Since 2010, I have had 10+ surgeries in the same leg for the same issues. The stenting surgery performed by Dr. Tabaie failed and my leg has continued to clot.

Five years later while being treated at Stanford for the failure of Dr. Tabaie's surgery, I was notified by Stanford Dr. Tabaie only called once. During this call, Tabaie was urged to transfer me to Stanford for appropriate care. Tabaie did not share this information with me and performed the surgery on his own.

I was referred to Dr. Tabak by my cardiologist and since my issue was quite concerning I researched the office after the fact by reaching out to various other physicians who unanimously recommended Dr. Tabak. Dr. Tabak is a scientist and his natural curiosity managed to narrow down the etiology of my problem by asking pointed questions about medical history and possible exposure. Lab work and coordination with my other physician provided an hypothesis that avoided a painful diagnostic procedure.,Male

"Dr. Taban is straight forward, raw, and to the point! he might come off as arrogant, but he is not...he also could get defensive is you question his decision, but most doctors do =) if you want an honest opinion, go to him. He is picky about insurance policies, therefore, do make sure he accepts your insurance. ",Male

I recently had a very serious lumbar surgery and after 6 weeks post-surgery, I am able to walk again without pain.

After seeing three different neurosurgeons, I chose Dr.Taban because he is the ""man""!  He is worth ""waiting"" for. Harriet S.",Male
Dr. Taban was the best experience I ever had. I had severe pain in my lower back that was affecting my walking and everything else. I already had back surgery a year prior to meeting him. The first surgery I had only made me worse. When I went to see Taban for a second opinion he immediately knew the problem. I had a 14 hour surgery and within a few days I was already walking. I am able to walk way better than I have in the last 4 yrs. I have already highly recommend him and his staff to others.,Male

"First of all, I felt the office was overcrowded, especially during this time of the COVID pandemic. Secondly, they did a myriad of tests without providing the results. Lastly, when I finally saw Dr. Taban, he seemed very rushed and was very impersonal. After he diagnosed glaucoma, he provided papers for me to read, instead of taking the time to explain. I was extremely disappointed with the visit.",Male

"Very caring, friendly and hard working doctor
",Male
"I had a Skype consultation with Dr. Taban about one ptotic eye and skin removal (blepharoplasty) on the other while I was in Europe. From the moment I talked to him I felt like I was in the right hands. He is extremely knowledgable, a leading scholar/publisher in the field, and a very caring and patient doctor. I decided shortly thereafter to schedule surgery (left eye ptosis and bilateral upper blepharoplasty) with him for July and I couldn't be happier with the results. He is the absolute best",Male
"Due to eye trauma, I had to undergo a complicated cataract surgery.  Dr. Taban performed the surgery and did a wonderful job.  He is very knowledgeable and considerate.  His staff is professional and courteous.  I highly recommend his services.  ",Male
"Dr Taban's Torrance office failed to provide a valid billing statement at the time of service. Repeated calls to his office did not solve this issue. His staff not only failed to provide the requested documents, but repeatedly failed to call back and/or email back any communications on the situation, despite promising to do so. My experience with this office rates less than 1-star. I will never use this office again.",Male
"Dr Taban is the best in probably the world.  He saved my vision from a retinal occlusion.
",Male
"Dr. Taban, is by far the very best in his field of practice. I was headed for a long and painful surgery for my left eye and with his skill I avoided the surgery. My eye is now perfect and my vision is 20/25. Thank you so much.",Male
"Dr. Taban is an excellent physician who helped restore my vision.  I called on a Saturday and left a message for him as his office was closed.  He returned my call after a few hours. Based on his keen observation, he knew this was an emergency and requested my husband and I  meet him at his downtown office.  Little did I know my eye condition would require immediate medical attention.   I shutter to think what would have happened had I not meet this wonderful doctor. I highly recommend him!",Male
"Today was my second visit to see Dr. Taban for upper eyelid filler, and it was truly a wonderful experience. I originally saw Dr. Taban over a year ago in his Santa Barbara office to express my concerns over my sunken in, wrinkly, and aging eyes. I was only 23 years old! He recommended 1 syringe of upper eyelid filler. Within 15 minutes of a comfortable and pain free experience, I walked out feeling like a new person. Although my visit was very short, the effect of his procedure on my confidence was astronomical. I felt like my age again! I now have youthful eyes, my eye makeup looks so much smoother, and I don’t think twice about having my picture taken. Now that it has been over a year, I wanted to touch up where the filler had gone down. This time, I only needed about half a syringe, and he offered to use the rest for my temples. The results are once again so stunning, yet extremely subtle and natural. I only trust Dr. Taban with such a delicate area, he is extremely well qualified,",Male
"Despite that we were in the middle of the covid crisis, my pre op appointments and surgery were very smooth. Dr. Taban is a most compassionate person who has very high standards. Healthcare has its challenges in this time yet Dr. Taban rises above those challenges creating a relationship of trust. I would consider it an honor to recommend Him.",Male
"Dr. Taban performed under eye lid surgery on me. I have been bothered by my under eye puffiness for a very long time until I found Dr. Taban. I am very pleased with the results that I got. I look refreshed and I also feel very happy. Thank you to Dr. Taban and staff for being welcoming and caring. Wish you all the best.
Mickey.",Male
I flew all the way from Atlanta for a one day trip to see doctor Taban. In my opinion he is the best at what he does. The treatment I received was the upper eyelid injections to fill out the hollowness of my lids due to a previous surgery. He took his time explaining the procedure and other procedures I plan to get date at a later time. I am very pleased with the results and I highly recommend him to anyone who has need for an eye surgeon.,Male
"DR. TABAN AGED ME 25 YEARS!!! Dealing with Dr. Taban was an utter nightmare and the surgical results were nothing short of horror. I underwent surgery for Ptosis and an accompanying Blepharoplasty. Dr. Taban added multiple eyelid creases giving me a hooded, reptilian appearance and the lids were unaligned. He was at a complete loss as to how to remedy his mess except to add filler — an absurd suggestion according to 2 other MDs who claimed fillers would only worsen the results due to the droop of added weight. Dr. Taban was unwilling to listen, refused to reimburse me a cent, and threw me out of his office! Dr. Taban may be a decent ophthalmologist but cosmetic surgery demands a fine hand and a good eye. He possesses neither.

Physicians are held to a certain standard of integrity but Dr. Taban lacks ALL trace of a conscience. His lack of expertise combined with a refusal to be held accountable, sullies the noble profession of medicine.",Male
"Dr Taban misled me and took advantage of me. H assured me that the procedure was safe and less recovery than an alternate procedure which has NO risks.His Brochure does not indicate any risks. Worst of all, in the fine print is a re;ease from all responsibility, I have a paralyzed left face as a direct result from Surgery....Beware!",Male
"Dr. Taban performed surgery on my eyelid in March 2020 and I was very pleased with both the results and the experience overall. The appearance of the eyelid has improved greatly, but I am especially impressed by how much better my eye feels. Dr. Taban provided clear explanations throughout the process, and was very accessible when I had questions after the procedure.",Male
I had ptosis and Dr. Taban did an excellent job making my eyes equal.  Very good surgeon!!,Male
"He did an eyebrow lift, eyelid lift and neck. I am extremely pleased with the results! He was recommended to me by two other doctors who said he is the best",Male
"Long story short, Dr. Taban is simply the best! I had my initial surgery to correct ptosis. It didn’t work and the results were not pretty. However, I consider myself extremely fortunate because I found Dr. Taban. After seeing his wonderful work, I decided to do a FaceTime consult. After that, I flew to California for the surgery. For my left eyelid, he performed a ptosis revision surgery using the internal approach. He also excised an extra skin fold. For the right eyelid, he used the external approach to lift the inner half of the eyelid. A few months later, I went back to get filler in the left eyelid to make things looks more symmetrical. I am extremely happy with my results! Aside from how skilled Dr. Taban is, I just wanted to mention how kind and caring he and his whole staff are! I felt comfortable and not worried at all because I knew that I was in good hands. I cannot recommend Dr. Taban enough if you are considering any type of oculoplastic surgery.",Male
"DR .TABAN IS A VERY TALENTED DOCTOR LOVE HIM . I HAD LOWER BLEPHAROPLASTY SURGERY . IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY RESULTS, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND . THANK YOU DR TABAN  GOD BLESS YOU",Male
"Experience:
Dr. Taban and staff is the best of the best! They don’t cut corners at this facility. Everyone is super thorough, kind, and detailed. There is such a warm and welcoming energy with this staff that helped put me at ease before undergoing this surgery. Even the anesthesiologist and nurse went above and beyond to make sure I felt great. It doesn’t get more elite than this. Worth every penny I spent and this surgery completely changed my life and made me so much more confident. I am forever grateful for Dr. Taban and his staff. 

Procedure:
I got Orbital Decompression, Almond eye, Under eye implant, and upper eyelid filler.
At a young age I developed bulging eyes and I became very self conscious with the way it altered my face. Not only did he give me the look I wanted, he exceeded my expectations!",Male
"I needed reconstructive work for basal cell carcinoma surgery on my lower eyelid .This was potentially a disfiguring surgery, but I knew Dr. Taban was extremely skilled so entrusted him for the repair . The results were excellent .No one can even tell I had surgery. I would highly recommend Dr. Taban. He and his staff are professional and happy to answer all questions.",Male
"I had MAJOR CONCERN with the development of looking tired all the time, even with a good nights rest.
 
  I decided to research who I thought would be the best Blephroplasty Sx for me online. I narrowed it down to Dr. Taban because of the positive reviews. 5 weeks ago I underwent my Blephroplasty Procedure. I must say,  I am overjoyed with the results of not having to be concerned with the tired look I used to have! Even my adult children said,  ""Mom! I see what the doctor did,  he did a good job!"" I have to agree.
 
 Not only does Dr. Taban have great bedside manners,  his work ethics is outstanding! He replies to any questions or concerns in a timely manner. He checked on me a few hours after my procedure was performed after I left his office just to make sure I was ok. 
 I will recommend Dr Taban to anyone who have concerns with their eyes. As a biracial women, with a mix of African American decent, I recommend Dr. Taban. Clearly, he is skilled at what he does.",Male
"I have been struggling with a severe case of Blepharitis with styes and chalazia as complications.  My case was so bad that I have sought out and have been referred to seven ophthalmologists in an attempt to get help.  I had one chalazion near my tear duct for over eight months and no oculoplastic surgeon would remove it because of its location.  Dr. Taban agreed that it would be complicated to remove, but he was confident that he could do it.  His staff got me in the next day for the outpatient procedure and within 20 min. I was free from the large chalazion that had been present for almost a year.  I have the utmost faith in Dr. Taban and am beyond grateful that I have found him!",Male
"Lower Blepharoplasty: Dr. Taban performed surgery on me 17 January 2019, in his Beverly Hills office. After doing my homework it was clear that Dr. Taban was the most qualified doctor. Both the surgery and recovery were easy and painless. Dr. Taban put me at ease with his kindness and expertise. When the time comes to do my upper lids, Dr. Taban will be my surgeon of choice!",Male
"Going to Dr. Taban was the best thing I've ever done for myself. He's one of the best oculoplastic surgeons in the business so I knew I was in good hands when I went to him for lower blepharoplasty. From the consult, prep, surgery and post-op, the experience was friendly and a breeze. I bruise easily and expected a slightly longer healing time but after two weeks bruising was completely gone and by week 4, my eyes finally reflect how I feel inside. 
 
People who don't know I've gotten this done are none the wiser which is exactly what I wanted. And I actually look forward to looking at myself in the mirror every morning. Thank you, Doc!",Male
"I had a great experience with Dr. Taban MD and his office staff. He is  professional as well as thorough with explanation of procedures. I had lower blepharoplasty, after being skeptical of having it done I am so happy I chose Dr. Taban for my procedure. I am very happy with my results! ",Male
"My experience with Dr. Taban , MD And staff was very pleasant and professional .I’m so pleased with my results. I wish I would’ve done  this years ago . I feel and look like my old self again bye-bye sunglasses but not the designer ones lol .Thank you so much  Dr Taban  God bless you And your family  you’re a true gem ",Male
"I highly recommend Dr. Taban! I wish I had gone to him for my original procedure, a lower blepharoplasty. Unfortunately after having it with another surgeon I had pretty severe ectropion. My original surgeon then performed a tarsal strip procedure which did not correct the problem and in fact made it harder to correct. It was a severe case and difficult to treat. I was so sad about my appearance and my eyes burned, were dry, and I could no longer wear contacts. I searched online for an expert, someone who could help me, and found Dr. Taban. He and his staff were very kind and I immediately knew I had chosen the right surgeon this time around. He knows what he is doing. I travelled to Beverly Hills and he performed a canthoplasty and mid-face lift to pull my lower eyelids up and have them stay up. It worked! Whether you need a cosmetic procedure or a medical one, Dr. Taban is the oculoplastic surgeon to see. ",Male
I've been a patient for nearly 10 years and couldn't be happier with what Dr. Tabandeh has done for me.,Male
"Dr. Tabandeh is highly respected and a well known ophthalmologist with a very busy practice due to high recommendations from his patients and referral by other doctors. He is very caring and takes his time to explain everything plainly and clearly. His diagnosis has been very accurate. 

I started seeing Dr. Tabandeh due to some eye complication that required laser surgery which he did an excellent job and cured the problem.",Male
"Dr. Tabandeh was recommended to me by another physician. He is thorough in examining his patients. He interacts in a serious yet kind and courteous  manner. Very professional! I recommend him to anyone who has retina problems. When I told him that I was going to visit a retina specialist in Iran and told him the name, he said he is one of the best in this field. You don't hear that very often from colleagues.
In summation Dr. Tabandeh is one of the best in his field. I could give him 10 stars!",Male
"He is the best doctor I know .i wish to give him 10 or 20 star .he is not only proffetional at his job ,also he is real human .my mom is diabetic .she was diagnosed bleeding on her right eye that causes her almost blindness.the only doctor could saved her vision was doctor tabandeh.he did sergery on her eyes and fix my mom eyes .he is very honest ,very kind and very very caring.he is not like of so many doctors that diagnosis wrong because for just making money ...god bless him and his family.",Male
"Muy bueno, como persona y como profesional, sobresaliente, estoy muy agradecido",Male
I give five stars because I feel on some level Dr. Tabandeh saved my life.  I had a retina detach. following my cataract surgeries. The detach occurred on a Fri pm and the next am early I was in surgery with him. His colleagues were extremely efficient in the operating room.  I felt safe and cared for even though it was a very traumatic experience in and of itself. I've seen 2 other drs at RV Assoc. during followups &amp; liked them all. I highly recommend. It's been 3yrs &amp; my eye is doing great!,Male
"Doctor Tabar is not only outstanding at what she does she is a REAL Human Being.  She is compassionate, understanding and treats you like a human being and never talks down to you.

"Referred Dr Tabar by Dr. Bains who is specialist in lung surgery, and she perforemed my wife's pituiatary tumor a week ago. When we met her for consultation, we felt she is somewhat shy but she gave us confidence. My wife's surgery went through well (clearly excellent), and having after surgery treatment well. And I have to mention Dr Cohen, who is Dr Tabar's neurosurgery team performed really well initial/finish nose surgery. So far we're really happay this neurosurgery team. Really!",Female
"I came to see Dr. Tabaraee in October 2019 after being in 24 hour  pain each day for 18 straight months. I had pain from a compressed nerve caused by a herniated L5 S1 disc. I previously had a failed microdiscectomy performed in December 2018 by another surgeon and a Radio frequency Ablation performed by my pain management doctor in September 2019 that didn’t do anything for me. Dr. Tabaraee performed an anterior and posterior L5 S1 spinal fusion on me in January of 2020. The surgery has helped me out a great deal and gave me my life back. I noticed the difference right away. I wish I would have found Dr. Tabaraee a year ago. I would like to thank Dr. Tabaraee for doing an excellent  job, also his physician assistant Angie, the rest of Dr Tabaraee’s staff, and also the front desk receptionists. ????",Male
"Outstanding!  I was a former gymnast/diver for 20 years.  I had on and off severe nerve pain in my legs for decades.  I could not walk any longer and had been referred to Dr. Tabaraee for an apptmt.  I have multiple schlerosis so I just wasn't sure how this whole ordeal would turn out.  I had a spinal fusion surgery and hoped for the best.  I think Tab is the most caring and knowledgeable physician I have had in decades, perhaps ever.  I commuted to Modesto from Cupertino for my surgery and all of my apptmts. because I was so impressed.  Love this guy!",Male
Great in room demeanor . Left with an understanding that this Gentleman understood my issues and great written follow up of exam  to all Dr. to undertand.,Male
"I met Dr. Tabaraee today for the first time. I was in a car accident and I am suffering from back and neck pain. He was very kind, professional, and thorough. This man really knows his stuff! I trust him already! Finally a Dr. who listens and cares! Strongly suggest Dr. Tabaraee.",Male
"We saw Dr. Tabaraee regarding my adult son's injury to his neck. He was incredibly relaxed, observant, thorough, and informative. The office was nice and the wait wasn't bad.",Male
"First time patient, that was me. I was nervous. Dr was very intuitive and i think he picked up on that. His calmness &amp; kind mannerisms we, 
my husband and I. We were  very thankful that we were having Ace Ehsan Tabaraee, M.D. help me with several spinal issues. His staff seems very confident and we like that alot. They also return calls in a timely manner .. We have NO reservations to referr him to family or friends. ",Male
I was in a horrible auto accident and broke both my legs..Dr Tabaraee and his team have helped and cared about my recovery and have answered every question I have had..I am now recovering very nicely due to all the hard work they have done to put me back together ,Male
Dr. Tabaraee was extremely helpful and easily explained the surgical procedure and recovery process to me which provided me with comfort and reassurance. He also performed the surgery and answered any concerns I had afterwards. I am very satisfied with the care I received under him and would recommend him to anyone. Thank you doctor for helping me get past this rough time in my life and for getting me back on track. ,Male
"I went to Dr. Tabaraee with a very specific pain and concern that he completely disregarded. I felt he was arrogant and didn't listen to me. I got second and third opinions from physicians in the area and the diagnosis he gave me was wrong. His treatment and care would have cost me a lot of money, time, and rehabilitation for a condition I didn't have to begin with. ",Male
"excellent care! she's a part time physician, so that may be why patients have a hard time booking appointments with her. she's thorough in her explanations and cares deeply for all of her patients! extremely warm!",Female
"Dr. Tabaraee is a nice person but I don't recommend her. She doesn't have the sense of urgency to take care of her patients and doesn't follow up actively on test results. In my case, when I told her about my symptoms, she just asked me to take pills to control the symptoms without test. I insisted to take the test and found issues. She didn't explain anything of the test result but a simple email without any follow ups.",Female
"She is a nice and warm person, however, I would not recommend because:
1. it is hard to schedule appointment (she seem to be out-of-office most of the time)
2. in my opinion, she does not explain procedures and causes well to the patient.
3. Once, she classified a preventive visit as non-preventive, and I got a big bill afterwards. Mistakes can happen, of course, but she would not even acknowledge it later, but kept insisting that I came for non-preventive reason.",Female
"Kind, patient, compassionate, thorough: I was very impressed with the quality of care I received from Dr, Tabares,",Male

"This doctor performed one of his first laprascopy procedures on me in 1995. It was done incorrectly and I almost bled to death in the hospital. Before the operation, he told me I would be power walking  about a week afterwards, but I was in bed for 5 months and could not work for 14 months, because I also suffered PSTD from the trauma of nearly dying. The entire experience put me $10,000 extra out of pocket for a psychotherapist and because I couldn't work.",Male

"Dr. Tabas is an impatient, snap-judgement diagnostician with only begrudging willingness to do what is necessary to get to the bottom of patients' issues, compounded by a lack of empathy. Don't put your health in his hands.",Male
Excellent doctor. Would highly recommend her.,Female
"Her wait times and the fact that that she ROUTINELY  cancels my appointments for the last two years make her not worth the trouble. There are too many good doctors out there to put up with her lack of professionalism and utter disrespect for patient’s time. I  am literally sitting in the parking lot writing this review. They called me the day before my appointment to ask me to reschedule to today. Five minutes after I checked in today the receptionist actually said, “Oh, by the way, Dr. Tabassi just left.”  Initially, I tolerated this because I liked her personality, but this is outrageous.",Female
"I have been a patient of Dr. Tabassi for well over 2 years and now that I am pregnant, due to deliver any day - I have nothing but wonderful things to say about her . As someone who has worked in the healthcare field for the last several years, the quality of care is so important to me and my family.
Dr. Tabassi takes her time but she is frank and to the point . I have no issues with the care I’ve received and I am comfortable enough to call her office anytime I have a question or concern . She has taken great care of me during this pregnancy and I will continue to rave about her .",Female
"Issue #1: the technician performed two different pelvic ultrasounds, and I was not informed they were doing two. Issue #2: I was told that I could not get my results over the phone, and that I had to make a second appointment. But I was not informed that a $120 fee would be applied. Issue #3: I attempted to reconcile the bill for 3 months, to no resolution. I will never recommend or see this doctor’s office, nor anywhere Vanessa Washington works ever again. Unclear billing, “incorrect coding,” personal indifference and manipulative customer service practices. It’s clear that my extra charges and payment was all they cared about, and that might explain how their new office suite is beyond fancy. It’s amazing what an office upgrade you can get when you treat your patients like trash.",Female
Extremely unprofessional.  From walking in and not being greeted by one person to me walking out of the appointment. I ended up walking out before my annual was even performed. ,Female
She is the worst doctor. If you are suffering from pain she wouldn’t help you. She just say I don’t know.Just find another doctor. I wish I could give the rate 0,Female
"Although I agree with other comments about long wait times, I still rank Dr. Tabassi 5 stars. This was my first pregnancy she was very hands on an caring, including her entire staff. I always felt at ease and comfortable knowing she was on top of my car for myself and baby. My delivery was great, I had to have a c-section for medical reasons, it was well performed and recovery was flawless due to her techniques. I am thankful to have had her throughout my pregnancy.",Female
"I don't know how dr Tabassi is, but her staff was very mean and rude. Shouted and screamed at the patients. Horrible day. Never see this kind staff before. ",Female
"negative 5 stars. Really bad experience there. Stay there over 3 hours, and get one sentence: you couldn't see Tabassi today, leave here or reschedule. Before this,  always answered me Dr Tabassi is with other patients. Nobody informed me she couldn't see me. and My husband had to call absence from his job. Finally, they told us,when we made the appointment, the front desk already told me Tabassi's assistant just see me today.my god, there are liars there.they know everything better than myself.",Female
I would have gave it a half star but unable to. If you have time to wait two hours after your appointment time than this is your place. Otherwise find someone else. It is not worth the wait.,Female
"Staff is the worst I have experienced. Rude, careless, unprifessional.

Dr.Tabassi is more interested in making extra money, than caring for the health of her patients. At least, this is what she has proved to me.

The very last thing she has done was making me wait 3 weeks to review an important Transvaginal Ultrasound that was done to find out if I had any form of cancer; since previous screens indicated a low grade displasia.  I am shocked by the lack of care this  woman has for her patients.",Female
"Wait times are horrendous. Wait is at least an hour past your appointment time, every time. I've been coming here for months and nothing has changed. They don't apologize for your wait and say it's because Tabassi spends time with her patients. I have yet to experience that. She is nice, but be prepared to spend half of your day in that office.

Absolutely the worst doctors office in Las Vegas.  I was re-scheduled 4 times first 2 appt were cxl due to the nurse practitioner walked off the job.....hummm wonder why?  3rd time because of needing to schedule an emergency C-section (ok I get it)....but a once the 4th was scheduled I am left sitting in the office for an 8:15am appointment and the doctor had not even arrived at the office.  The desk staff has no clue where she is.  Dr. has zero respect for the impact it has on her patients.,Female
"Dr. Tabassi is awesome, she is very professional but at the same time she has a great sense of humor! Her staff is very nice as well and although you may have a bit of wait, she is well worth it! She was recommened to me by a co-worker and switching to her was one of the best decisions I've made! We need more like her who truly cares about her patients!",Female
"Please come ready to wait. Wait here is atleast 2 hours. Doctor is always late. Not because she's spending time with patients but because she shows up late to the office. Staff communication is very poor. When asked to leave info , they call after hours several days later so that they can't be reached when you try to call back. And when you get a hold of someone they state they have the info you originally left and will turn it over to the person it needs to go to. I wish someone had warned me.",Female

He asked a few questions and recommended a biopsy to rul out cancer, he assured me that it was going to be fairly painless and would be back to normal in a few hours. He performed the biopsy and send me home. When the anesthesia wore off unbearable pain started and I was bleeding profusely, I was bedridden for two days with pain and bleeding. My results came back negative and he recommended to continue monitoring. My PSA continued a slow but steady rise, he recommended that we did another biopsy. He never recommended less invasive diagnosis methods. When I was reluctant to another biopsy, he delegated me to his nurse practitioner and never saw me again. I have a friend that was treated by him and performed prostatic reduction surgery and he went back under the knife the next day.

I also had an appointment that turned out to be on a day the office was randomly closed, and no one informed me of this before I made the trip out to the office. The medical assistants at her office were very kind, and the office was clean, but these are the only redeeming qualities for this doctor.",Female

Insulted my occupation after she asked what I do, then literally doubted my health history and said I'll give you antibiotics since that's what you seem to want so badly, when I wasn't asking for them.

Although the building is nice the service is unprofessional.

Last time it took more than 3-4 WHOLE HOURS to see the doctor and then he kept reachin for the door and making gestures he had to leave after only being there 15 mins. Office REALLY overschedules.

Dr. Ubaids has the worst medical office staff that is unprofessional. Honestly they don't even pretend to care.,Male
He is very difficult to understand. He ordered me an MRI and never reviewed it then proceeded to order me another. He ordered me to take medication and didn’t know why. I’ve been waiting to get a sleep study for over 3 months. The office staff NEVER calls me back. At one point I had to have primary dr reach out to him for answers. Cancelled my next appt. Will not be going back to him. Him and his office staff are useless. No wonder our insurance rates are so high.,Male
"As  others have commented Dr. Ubaid doctor seems capable (only saw him twice) but the communication system is clearly lacking. Leaving messages does not generate a call back, and I have yet to speak with anyone. I ended up canceling the next appointment for my mother and will find someone else. The assisted-living where my mother is ended up faxing the office TWICE after leaving several messages  and only then did she get a return call. I find that to be unacceptable. ",Male
"Dr. Ubaid has a good bedside manner, and seems to actively listen to me when I discuss issues with him, but his office's scheduling and organization are chaotic at best. Initial appointment took weeks to get scheduled.  I've been waiting since July to get a sleep study done, and they keep failing to schedule it for me. They won't take patient calls, meaning you need to leave a phone message and wait a few days for a call back, if they call back. My best luck is via online communication.",Male
"The Dr himself is good but staff is horrible. When calling can't get past an automated system.  Staff will not call you back if you manage to even find an option that lets you leave a message.

I called back in mid nov &amp; staff apologized for lack of response, swore they'd call soon.  Now Dec 7th-STILL NO CALL.",Male
"Dr. Ubaid is one of the best doctors that I ever met, he is a kind, respectful and extremely knowledgeable Physician, he spend whatever time listening to his patient, his diagnosis always accurate and give you the best way of treatment, If you are looking for a truly outstanding Neurologist, I recommend Dr. Ubaid Shaikh.

"I have been going to Dr. Ubele for some time now. She is very personable and easy to talk to even for uncomfortable topics. She has helped me manage my medical problems for years and even helped me with things to tall to my surgeon about prior to having surgery. Overall I'd give her 10/10. It can be difficult to schedule a last minute appointment because she books up fast but I've always been able to get in with another doc, the scheduling service call center is not 5 star, as they get very rude",Female
"At a time when most patients feel like they are just a number and a statistic, Dr. Ubele takes the time to educate you regarding your personal problems. She was instrumental in finding my initial cancer diagnosis, lymphoma and because of her being so conscientious she insisted I have a colonoscopy where it was discovered I had a cancerous mass. I would highly recommend her to my family and friends, without reservation. I am thankful to have her as my family physician.",Female
"Dr. Ubele and her assistant were rude and insulting.  Dr. Ubele insulted me about one of my medical issues right in front of my daughter with no regards to how it made me feel or my daughter feel. She referred to me with ADD as being metally, ""not right"" and said it in with such a demeaning way. I was embarrassed. She was so very unprofessional!! Her assistant was just rude every visit! Made me so uncomfortable I left the practice. Not the best team that Kennady has to offer!!

"My younger brother was referred to Dr.Ubell for a lump on his neck- Dr.Ubell was very knowledgeable and made a quick and accurate diagnosis. Thankfully after Dr.Ubell ordered an ultrasound of my brother's neck the lump turned out to be nothing serious, it was just an enlarged gland but it was still a scary thing to go through as a family. Dr.Ubell's bedside manner was phenomenal, you can tell he is a very genuine person and really cares about his patients. Dr.Ubell's extensive knowledge and compassion helped to ease my mother's nerves! A few other members of my family have also seen Dr.Ubell in the past and he has been great every time, I would 100% recommend Dr.Ubell to anyone.",Male
"I saw Dr. Ubell in 2018 for hoarseness and difficulty speaking for a couple of months. After ""speaking to him"" and answering some questions, he performed an endoscopy for diagnosis. What meant the most to me was the look on his face and sound of relief in his voice when he said, ""from the degree of hoarseness and speech loss, I was very concerned that it was cancer"". Instead he made the diagnosis of probable intubation injury from two weeks in the ICU for double pneumonia.  He ordered speech therapy for voice strengthening exercises to get my speech back. 
I saw him recently for hearing loss and he was just as kind and compassionate at this visit as with the first. I have and will continue to recommend him to all my family and friends.
None better!!!",Male
"BEWARE of COSTS with this organization all about PROFIT over PATIENT!
I went to Dr. Kass for Hearing Loss. He was a very nice Dr but when I was at the office he said he needed to put steroids in my inner ear.  It took max 3 minutes for him to do. I was in and out of his office in 15 minutes.  Most of the time sitting in the chair letting the steroids drain. Then came the SHOCK to me a $543.59 bill after insurance paid $2930.41.  No mention from the doctor that this would be an expensive procedure.  I didn’t get the bill until after I came back a second time to see Dr. Ubell who said “the first round did nothing maybe we should try it again what do you think?”  I should have wrote SUCKER on my forehead because this time he didn’t have to do anything because the hole was already there he just needed to administer the steroids and another $543.59 bill after insurance paid $2930.41.  Billing said the price was set by the AMA and that is the standard price.  She also said you have the right",Male

I've been a patient of Dr. Uberoi for several years, and he has guided me through a ""watchful waiting"" period leading to a biopsy and ultimately prostate surgery (Dr Cleary).

"I went Dr. Uberoi with a complaint of a very slow urine stream. After my examination he recommended that I have a treatment that  consisted of using a laser treatment (Green) to release the swelling around my bladder and urethra. After having this surgery which was done as an out patient procedure, I was able to go home with minor discomfort. I just had to wear a catheter overnight and the next day I went back in to have it removed. The next day my urine flow had improved over 100% to the point that i felt when I did use the restroom what was taking me 3 to 4 minutes to empty mt bladder, was being now achieved in 15 seconds. I recommend this surgery for any man who have difficulty urinating with a weak flow. My flow is so strong now that it feels and look like a water hose when i use the restroom.",Male
Incredibly personable and professional. Exactly the kind of doctor you want to have by your side. ,Male

She didn't seem interested.   This is exactly what she told.... ""You're getting old so your going to hurt more.""   I told her that my neck hurt so bad that I couldn't sleep and told me to ""get a new pillow.""   This was a total waste of time.",Female
Dr. Uberoi is compassionate and practical. He has worked with me to solve sensitive urological problems even when they have been complex and not easy to figure out.

She said that it was too much paperwork for her to fill out and she just wasn't going to do it. I did not think to ask where that paragraph was written in the Hippocratic Oath she had to take as a physician.  She told me to see someone in behavioral medicine. I am unable to get in until 10/19/17, over 7 months w/o meds",Female
DO NOT GO TO HER. She is the primary care of all my family members and she truly does not offer any advice or express concern towards anyone. She's a prideful doctor who does not deliver the best care to her patients. My bp has been high for multiple months now and she didn't even care to mention it. Stay away. Do not go off the aurora health care reviews as you need to account to review a doc. Such a disappointing doctor. Does not listen to concerns nor offer any help. Stay away ,Female

She doesn't have any people skills and should not be allowed to serve the general public. Again she is very RUDE, and careless to be kind to Dr. Ubesie patient.

Dr. Ubesie stopped delivering at the hospital I was covered under when I was 35 weeks pregnant and told me he would deliver me at another hospital. Turns out, he didn't have privileges there and didn't deliver me. He also prescribed me the wrong kind of birth control postpartum despite my double checking.",Male
"He is an excellent doctor! Very experienced, caring, and always explains everything to me in detail. I would recommend him to anyone. Best doctor in Houston!",Male
"The office staff was unprofessional, did not return phone calls and made me feel as if I was a second class patient. Dr. Ubesie was a kind doctor who took time to address my concerns and questions.

"If I had the opportunity, I will give her no stars. She is very unprofessional as to how she meets new patients.  She was new in the office   And understood she did not know everyone.

The staff is rude. The doctor is very much against the patient. Making comments like about the patient to the staff about the patient embellishing their pain or when the patient has a broken right foot about it being a ploy not to drive. She will argue with you about what is wrong or whay type of surgery you had and she makes you wait up to 45 minutes to see her if she does not care for you.

After the operation I had follow-up office visits for the next 2 months.  Dr Ucciferri was always very pleasant and provided useful information regarding my recovery.  His  support staff were extremely nice and helpful.  I would recommend Dr Ucciferri and his staff 100%",Male
Super nice and very kind doctor. I highly recommend him.,Male
"I will never go back to Dr. Ucciferri and do not recommend him.  He did nothing to help me and my pain is worse than ever.  He was rushed, rude and condescending.  A little too full of himself.",Male
"Dr Ucciferri was amazing, he was very kind and trustworthy.  He explained everything that he was going to do and assured me that there would be minimal pain during the process.  I would recommend him ten times over to someone.",Male
"I was suffering from extreme ankle pain for months before I came to see Dr. Ucciferri.  I'm extremely fearful of injections, which was what kept me from coming in sooner. When the pain was just to much bare, I finally went to see him and he gave me a cortisone injection that I didn't even feel, casted me for orthotics and wrapped my foot. I have been great ever since. I would highly recommend him to family and friends he is amazing doctor.",Male
I would recommend to stay far away from Dr. U.. He diagnosed me totally wrong and others I no of. I went to two other Doctors and they told me the that I just needed orthotics. He wanted to do surgery on me. These other doctor were so shocked that they could not believe it.,Male
"I only can highly recommend Dr. Ucciferri, Excellent Doctor. For month I had constant pain walking,  wearing  shoes was very painful, after two appointment at the office ,I can wear my shoes again with no pain.
His staff are very friendly and caring.
                                                                  E. Schroeder",Male
"Dr. Ucciferri is punctual, attentive, respectful, informative and professional. ",Male
"My children &amp; I were treated at various times for various foot &amp; ankle ailments. Dr Ucciferri is excellent. He approaches remedies conservatively, trying to avoid surgery if possible. I was the only one to have surgery performed by him and he fixed a problem that I have dealt with for far too long. It was quick and recovery went well with just a minor incision. The only thing that I do not like is sometimes having to wait past my appointment time. I gladly wait for quality care.",Male
"I highly recommend Dr. Ucceferri, I was in constant pain in both of my feet. I went to other doctors that actually signed off on me and said there was nothing they could do, they actually released me as a patient and walked away from me leaving me with no solution to my problem. Dr. Ucceferri agreed to take a look and see me. He had a few ideas that he wanted to try. I figured that I had nothing to lose. His idea worked and as each day passes I have little or no pain, getting better each day.",Male
"OMG, I  must write a review for Dr. Uceda, my mother is a dialysis patient,  she was going to another Doctor at Baylor Plano, the vascular surgeon that was her doctor for over 4 years basically gave up on my mom, her old fitula stopped working in her left arm, and the Baylor surgeon replaced a new one in her right arm, after 3  weeks it stopped working,  the doctor told my mom that there was nothing else he could do except put in a permacath for her.   I said that to say this my mom went to see",Male
"Dr. Uceda was very patient and spent time with me explaining my injury and various options.  He didn't immediately push me to have surgery and took the effort to explain my options and potential outcomes.
",Male
"Dr Uceda took only 5 (FIVE) minutes to diagnose my problem.
Informed me that I had a lower hernia and a torn upper stomach muscle then he left
the room.
Did not tell me if surgery was required, if medication was needed, or what type of therapy
my situation required.",Male
Had hernia surgery and this was followup.  Had staples removed.  Very professional and courteous.  No wait.,Male
"The staff is excellent, friendly and answer all of your questions.  I feel like I’m a part of the family.  Dr. Uchal is the best!  My surgery went well and he explained everything that I would experience and what I should expect down the road.  He has a great sense of humor to match his skill!",Male
"Dr. Uchal was recommended by my granddaughter, a nurse. He is like an old friend, I always felt comfortable, never rushed, he is a good listener and he has a great sense of humor. But most importantly Dr. Uchal is a competent and thoughtful surgeon. His staff is professional and have taken measures to keep us safe in the office during this pandemic. Dr. Uchal performed my bariatric bypass Dec. 2019. I was 65 years old and had no complications. I have lost 97 lbs. and counting.  This was one of the best decisions I have made for myself and Dr. Uchal is one of the best doctors I have ever had. I have already recommended Dr. Uchal to my own daughter.",Male
Dr. Uchal is the best!  He tells you what you need to have done clearly and leaves no room for doubt.  I love the way he showed care and compassion for my specific case.  He also incorporates a sense of humor that I appreciate.  I would highly recommend him and his team for your medical needs.  He will not disappoint.,Male
"I found the North Florida Surgeons staff to be helpful and attentive to my needs.  They are easy to work with and always available to answer questions.  Dr. Miroslav Uchal has a straightforward approach which I greatly appreciated.  He listened to my concerns about the procedure I was having, answered all of my questions then came back to discuss the details of my surgery to include any additional procedures that maybe needed.  I felt confident going into the surgery and am extremely satisfied with the outcome.  I have no reservations in recommending Dr. Miroslav Uchal and North Florida Surgeons.",Male
Dr Uchal pays thorough attention to my care.  His office staff are efficient and kind.,Male
"The most supportive and awesome office I've ever been to! I always feel welcome and taken care of, my health is improving every single day thanks to Dr. Uchal and his team!

"yes for sure, always feel un rushed and staff is great. Very friendly, don't feel like cattle feel like ya matter",Male
"I would highly recommend Dr. Uchal. His staff was very professional.  I have been under another drs care for a chronic cough for 3 1/2 years. No one could find the right diagnosis. It turned out that I need surgery for a hernia. I feel 100 times better, losing weight and returning to work earlier then expected.  Thank you Dr. Uchal.",Male
"My visits with Dr. Uchal are pleasant and informative. I wish I had met him years earlier.   He performed my gastric sleeve in Nov I have lost 73 lbs and have had no problems, no pain or discomfort.",Male
Dr. Uchal and his staff were very personable and professional. I would highly recommend them.  The surgery and the care I received afterwards was top notch!,Male
"adding to my last review I ran out of characters. I am so thankful for Dr. Uchal for doing my surgery. I just went to visit him on 3/12/2020 and I told him thank you I am no longer in pain, I can walk with out pain, I have not gotten sick. I am a new woman with a new lease on life. I just want to say THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Dr. Uchal for all you have done to save my life and giving me the feeling of living again with any pain. I am so Happy Happy Happy and full of life. God has given you and wonder gift your mind your heart and your hands. You, are a wonderful Doctor and I would recommend anyone to you.",Male
"I met Dr. Miro Uchal a little over a year ago, due to a ventral hernia.  Adhering  to a tight and heavy work schedule, I put off the surgery until December 23, 2019. Dr. Uchal is a very rare doctor/surgeon.  Unlike many doctors I have seen in the past, and there have been many, he takes as much time as needed to explain everything. He came highly recommended to me and I can see why.  His caring bedside manner, character, and integrity are second to none and he is a doctor any young resident, or even an established physician should aspire to emulate. He  addressed another related issue he felt I should have checked.  I have since followed up on his advice and, thankfully, I am now being treated to control that concern.  I would not only highly recommend this very skilled physician to others, but to my own family, as well.  I feel very fortunate that another doctor referred me to Dr. Uchal.  He and his staff, special thanks to Macy, are simply the best!  Not enough stars to check!!!",Male
Dr. Uchal and his staff are amazing. I’ve been a successful gastric bypass patient with him. My surgery was 7/1/2019 and I am 65 pounds down. I am very pleased with my results and care that’s has been provided to me !,Male
I feel Dr. Uchal truly saved my life.  I dropped 180 lbs and have kept it off for more than 4.5 years now.,Male
"My sister had to have small bowel obstruction remove.  I could not ask for a better or more caring doctor.  He was by to check on her at least twice a day.  He kept me informed of all the progress she was making.  Again I thank him for his time, caring and skill as a surgeon.  I would highly recommended him to anyone needing surgery.
",Male
This dr and his staff are wonderful i would definitely recommend him he done a great job with my sugrey!!!!,Male
"Refreshing to find a surgeon that has such a passion for people. Unlike all I’ve met in the past. Very down to earth, really has a passion for helping people. Always takes his time to explain anything you may not understand. Not feeling rushed in and out of appointment feels great!",Male
"Dr. Uchal is an amazing doctor.
He has been a true blessing to me and my family. We can't even begin to thank him for all he has done for me.",Male
"Dr. Uchal is an amazing surgeon. He is skilled, honest, respectful, and experienced. I would trust him to care for and operate on any one of my love ones. He is definitely not a sugar coater and he will call you out if you haven't been following his instructions. I appreciate that quality in him because it encourages his patients to assume responsibility for their own health. I have had two surgeries with Dr. Uchal within the last four years. I experienced no complications with either surgery.",Male
The not do good job the just still people money  and call police for you is not right the still my $300 dollar  3 week ago and not trying to make  you  understand,Male
"In the past with the previous staff things got done appointments flowed smoothly and I didn't have to question if my referrals were sent or go thru hoops to speak to the doctor. The new staff is not helpful besides two girls. The front desk lady thinks she too cute to get her hands dirty and is of NO HELP!!! Dava is run raggedy because of the lack of her teammates it's awful. Dr Uche is an exceptional doctor very knowledgeable however his staff makes him look bad. Saw his colleague and he changed my whole bp prescription and this was his first time seeing me!!! Not to mention during the visit he called me a hypochondriac. The last straw I have had a rash to come all over my body and he treated it with a topical cream then a steroid then gave up and pushed me thru to a dermatologist with no openings till January. So basically I'm still in pain with a hot rash with no meds or resolution till January I guess????Unfortunately, as much as I like him I will no longer use him as a PCP for all",Male
"It was my first time going and i felt comfortable there, the staff was very nice and Dr Uche was very nice and easy to talk to.",Male
"So warm, welcoming and thorough. This doctor was also very easy to talk to. ",Male
Went in for my first appt last week.  I actually saw the PA BUT Dr Uche came in towards the end of visit. Both of them were very knowledgeable and attentive. Staff was very nice and seemed to be on top of their game. ,Male
"I've been seeing Dr. Uche for over 2 years, he is anot amazing doctor, extremely knowledgeable,  caring and thorough...always gives his 100% attention and focus on me and my health issues. Very diligent in finding and treating my health in the most effective,  safest way. 
I am extremely grateful for him and would highly recommend him to anyone.",Male
The doctor was very professional and knowledgeable.. Wonderful clinic..Great experience ,Male
Excellent office staff and clinic. I was seen very quickly and treated very well. Dr Uche listened to me and made me feel very comfortable. I was very pleased with his care.,Male
Horrible. Doctorr...care more for his self then patients......wouldnt let him treat my cat,Male
"Dr Uche was my infectious disease specialist when I was admitted to ICU in critical condition with sepsis and a serious liver abscess. 

Dr Uche is patient, explains everything in layman’s terms and gas phenomenal bedside manner. 

I am now better and still see him for follow up exams. 

I was lucky and am grateful that he was assigned to my case. 

He is one of the finest physicians I have encountered.",Male
"Easy to work with, well educated on the newest treatments. takes time to talk and understand, easy to reach",Male
"Dr Uchi is a very knowledgeable practitioner. Dr Uchi explains everything with you and allows you to be a part of the decision making process. He always keeps the patient in the loop. Dr Uchi is also very easy to talk with and easy to ask questions. I recommend Dr Uchi if you need a good Infectious Disease Doctor.  
",Male
I had an abnormal EKG in my general practitioners office prior to knee surgery. I was referred toDr Uche. Instead of doing another EKG he proceeded to tell me that it looked like I had a blockage and that no anesthesiologist would touch me with an EKG like that. Instead I was scheduled for a battery of expensive tests that showed that everything was normal. It took 3 weeks for the tests and another appointment to review the results. No sense of urgency regarding the scheduling of tests.,Male
"Theee worst doctor ever. My last visit, WAS MY LAST VISIT.  I could tell him my foot hurt, and he'll ask me when was my last pap. What that got to do with the price of butter? His attitude sucked, he acted like he had rather been twerkin outside in a blizzard than to see to my needs. I walked out and didnt bother scheduling another appointment with him. NO WAY! And the way he talked to his nurse was ridiculous. I hurried up and found me another doctor. A REAL doctor. A GOOD doctor. ",Male
"I trust Dr. Uche, and he has taken good care of my health.",Male
"Although the office staff and nurses were quite kind and helpful, Dr. Uche was completely unhelpful and unresponsive to my concerns and explanation of my symptoms. In short, his medside manner was horrible. ",Male
"My elderly mother was a patient of Dr. Hyacinth several years ago.  Honestly, I didn't expect much being that he works in an urban clinic in an economically challenged area.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  He actually listened to her without condescension and responded to her concerns with kindness and professionalism.  I've been to many doctors working in expensive private practices in exclusive neighborhoods but haven't seen a better physician than Dr. Hyacinth.",Male
"He is not only our family doctor (Me, my husband, my mother and my three kids), he is a friend. Always friendly, polite and so professional,  he knows our names, we aren't a file number. Dr. Ucheagwu is an extinct kind of doctor, he takes care everyone the same, and the most important  for me is that he works with until you are healed and more. So thankful! ",Male
She is such an amazing doctor. Does anyone know where she is currently practicing?,Female
Very disappointed that she no longer practices in lewisburg PA. EVANGELICAL lost a wonderful provider.,Female
"Amazing physician. Friendly, personable, well-spoken.
Wish we had met 20 years ago!
She is #1 on my recommendation list for GYN.",Female
She is the most helpful and understanding Doctor I have ever had. I absolutely adore her and would recommend her to everyone. I just recommended her to my sister this morning. ,Female
"She is an amazing person and Physician. Very personable, listens to your concerns, and takes the time to explain things.  Outstanding! ",Female
"The DR reviewed my son's medical history prior to our visit, he and his staff are amazing. ",Male
"Dr. Uchida is a great professional and insanely organized PCP.  She listens and answers in plain English, as well as taking her time to address all the needs even if it takes longer than the scheduled time. She works closely with her nurse, in case I have questions regarding prescriptions.",Female
"Dr. Uchida is a walking book, but she is not a doctor for patients with a history of health problems or a potential for them.  She is more interested in her professional career at the university than she is in client care.  I should have followed my instincts and switched doctors several years ago.  Now I pay the price...",Female
"Dr Uchiha is an excellent, intelligent, and thoughtful doctor. I've known her for years, even before I had health insurance: I was a patient of hers back when she was still with the Cook County Heath system.  After she moved to Northwestern I came back to her after I got FT work and health insurance. She is direct but caring, and really listens to her patients. She also believes in preventative medicine and didn't just push pills. I'm very happy with her!",Female
Was sharp and bright as a new physician. After many years level of quality care has dropping significantly. Not so sharp and missed diagnosis for several years.,Female
"Doesn't listen to the patient. Easily disregards patient complaints and symptoms as anxiety, in spite of presence of physical symptoms. Missed diagnoses for many years in spite of obvious symptoms.",Female
"Dr. Uchida is wonderful, caring and supportive doctor. Test results and questions are answered promptly via email. She has a excellent bed-side manner and has been my primary doctor for more than 10+ years.",Female
"He and his nurse were great. Took plenty of time with us and didn’t make us feel rushed or like a pest for asking so many questions. He explained things and made us feel comfortable.  The female at the main front desk did not greet us warmly and wasn’t too helpful at first,  telling us to check-in and if we need help let her know. As we sat there though we quickly realized she was just overwhelmed and busy with the phone and patients but ended up being kind/helpful, she just could’ve used help. ",Male
I was advised by my urologist that due to bladder cancer he needed to remove my bladder.   I sought a second opinion in Dr Uchio.   He provided a different treatment and 5 years later I still have my bladder cancer free.  A highly skilled physician.,Male
"Dr. Uchio did my prostate biopsy.  The procedure was painless, but very uncomfortable.  He explained the procedure as he did it and had a good bedside manner.  My only complaint was with scheduling.  It took me over 6 weeks to get my 1st appointment with him.  Then another 2 weeks to schedule the biopsy.  I have a very aggressive cancer....waiting long periods of time for appointments does not work towards a good outcome.",Male
Excellent doctor with very passionate to patient and with superb surgical sckill.,Male
"she was an uncaring, thoughtless, and did anything but make me comfortable. As  person with terminal cancer I was berated by her, accused of abusing my meds and when her superiors thought her action and conduct were very out of line and she was forced to apologize. She was even demeaning and pompous when apologizing. She is not a good doctor or even a good person ",Female
"Would not recommend Dr. Uchiyama. When he walked in to see me for my first and only consult, I politely asked him to review my MRI report, which he refused. He relied on himself to visually look at the images. This is never a good sign. A neurosurgeon's job is top operate, a neuroradiologist's job is to interpret these images. Almost everything the radiologist noted - severe cervical stenosis, foraminal stenosis, facet arthropathy, annual disc tear, he denied was there. Didn't make any sense. Although he did spend a good amount of time with me, it ended up being a waste in the end because he did not appreciate the level of pain and neurological deficits I was suffering, due to all my disc issues. Even the non surgical treatments he suggested, like physical therapy and/or pain management - he did not provide a prescription for. After getting a copy of my medical records, he also wrote things in there that did not actually occur during my office visit.",Male
"Dr Uchiyama is a wonderful Neuro Surgeon who truly cares about his patients. I had ACDF of C4-6 in 2017. Unfortunately, I have to undergo a second neck surgery &amp; I trust Dr Uchiyama tremendously. He is strongly recommended to see for your neurological/spinal needs. I researched other surgeons in CA &amp; WA with different approaches. However, I felt Dr Uchiyama’s recommendation was less invasive &amp; had a much stronger success rate.
Truly one of a kind. Professional &amp; compassionate. Sandra, his Office Coordinator:
/Super Hero is also amazing &amp; Dr Vastola is extremely patient &amp; kind. She shares her expertise to keep you at ease. Everyone at Scripps Green is caring, helpful &amp; professional. Although I am not looking forward to this second neck surgery, I am confident in my Team.",Male
RUDE wish  could give minus stars,Male
"He may have good hands, but he is sorely lacking in a good heart. He gave me pain meds post surgery and, when I asked for supervision, neither he nor his assistants were available to me. I had a bad reaction and even worse withdrawal. When I gave him a less than good review and asked if I could speak to other patients, he initially said that if I mentioned my opinions to anyone else he would ""terminate me as a patient"" (his EXACT words) and refused to allow me to speak to any other patient.",Male
"I can't speak to his skills as a physician but I'm sure they're good.
I can speak to his office's scheduling skills and they're poor. I was called almost immediately from the main waiting room and then  I waited 60 minutes in the small room. I was told he was running behind twice.  Granted the nurse was very polite.  But after 60 min, I left. I was told I could reschedule.....in 2 months or see a physician's assistant.  I chose neither.

Sorry, waiting 60min + in the small room, not acceptable",Male
"The most kind and compassionate doctor ever! Dr. Uchiyama is my Superman. He always takes the time to explain things and has never given up hope in finding solutions. He also has an awesome supportive team-his PA’s- Josh &amp; Alia, RN’s-Andrea &amp; Gina and his secretary, Sandra is the absolute best-who always stays on top of dealing with the insurance companies. I highly recommend Dr. Uchiyama! ",Male
"I was recommended to Dr. Uchiyama by my primary doctor who was treated by Dr. U.  I had to wait 3 months for an appointment but it was definitely worth it.  He is thorough, offers explanations that are easy to understand, attentive, patient and listens. I needed surgery and he and his team were amazing all of the way.  The person who rated him a one star must have seen a different doctor.  His team is extremely responsive, easy to contact, very professional and I 100% recommend.",Male
"I saw dr uchiyama for low back pain. I ended up needing surgery. Dr uchiyama is extremely knowledgable, straight to the point, experienced, honest, caring &amp; only will suggest &amp; do what is best for you. His PA, Joshua Del Hommee is also wonderful! I would NEVER even suggest that a patient see anyone except these two! I have found the best &amp; will stay with them! Staff if kind, empathetic &amp; understanding also. What a great package deal ~ i have NO complaints AT ALL (i'm usually critical too!)lol ??",Male

"Walking through the door I was greeted by staff who showed caring of my safety, the staff and the doctor's by taking my temperature and asking precautionary COVID 19 questions. This office is large and equipped with enough pleasant staff members to keep me going before it's time to be evaluated by the doctor. Each employee were so nice to be around. Based on my condition and diagnosis Dr. Uchiyama gave me a truthful and professional plan of care. He immediately started working on my damaged eyes, not advising me to come back for another appointment and charging my insurance. Each visit he worked my eyes and his hands over the limit to help me.  I truly appreciate all that he has done for me and I strongly recommend his services to anyone I know and anyone reading this.",Male
"Dr. Uchiyama's knowledge, experience, and kindness not only saved my sight, he probably even saved my life.  I could not be more grateful to be referred to him.  He's the best.",Male
"He is not really my Dr. He was seeing patients of Dr. Kelly at Wellington and I happened to come in for an emergency visit. I have to say sadly that he is not  personable Dr. or seemed genuinely concerned about my condition. 
I would not want him to be my Dr.",Male
"Dr Uchiyama is the BEST! After complications from cataract surgery he was able to resolve my issues and restore my eyesight. He and his staff are a pleasure, they go out of their way to be helpful and courteous. Without him i may have lost my sight. Thank you Dr.",Male
"Last year during a hurricane, I suffered from a Retina detachment that required immediate surgery. Presenting a challenge, Dr. Uchiyama performed  my  ""not so typical"" surgery and saved my retina. I am eternally grateful for his kindness, Professionalism, and humble demeanor. I completely felt comfortable through the entire process. Words cannot express my gratitude.",Male
"To me, the rapidness with which I was losing my eyesight was terrifying.  Other eye doctors recommended Dr. Uchiyama immediately and i have been grateful every day since.  The minute I met him I knew he wanted to help and that he knew   what to do.  I could not be asleep
for my surgery since Dr. Uchiyama needed me to hold my eye in certain positions while he removed a growth from my retina.  (And i know he forgave me for twitching a bit)  His abilities as a surgeon are incredible because I could see everything he did with his instrument.  I can see much better now and keep regular appointments with Dr. Uchiyama.  He has my best interests in mind and his knowledge is priceless to me.
And from my experience his concern for all his patients is the same.  He has my respect and i am grateful beyond words.
A thought:  If a 10 to 15 min wait time bothers anyone, think about why it takes that 'long'.  That is nothing when you consider the quality of care &amp; knowledge you will receive!",Male
"Dr.Ushiyama is an excellent physician.He communicates with the patient and listens to your needs.

Dr. Uchiyama opened his office on a Saturday afternoon to check out my compliant.  He was on call and had never met me before.  He examined me and determined that I had a detached retina.  He scheduled me for surgery the following AM.  I thank him for saving the vision in that eye  as well as repairing tears in both retinas.  He is a wonderful caring MD.  I recommend him highly ,Male
"It's been 15 months, and I could not be happier with Dr. Uchiyama. He has been with me every step of the way,  What started as a virus on my retina, led to a detachment plus a 2nd surgery to remove the oil. It has now been one year since the detachment surgery and six months since the oil removal.  He told me I had a 1 in 4 chance of the retina detaching again.  It didn't.  I know it was from Dr. Uchiyama;'s expertise and amazing follow-up care. He cared about my outcome.",Male
My optometrist referred me to Dr. Uchimaya and he was able to see me within a few hours  Due to a detached retina he suggested I have surgery immediately  He explained everything to my understanding and shared the risks and benefits of the surgery  One of my daughters was with me at every doctor visit.

I went to several doctors including Bascom Palmer and no one could help me with my Iritis. Every doctor knew what I had but not why or how to cure it. Finally I went to see Dr Eduardo Uchiyama..  what a wonderful day that was I cannot say enough good things about him. After telling him all that I have been through  he was so sure he could help me and he did. One day I thought I was losing my vision now I see better then before. I would never hesitate to recommend this Doctor Who is the best.,Male
"Dr. Uchiyama performed my retina detachment surgery about six weeks ago.  After a severe case of uveitis and other rare eye issues, Dr. Uchiyama wanted a complete and through follow-up schedule.  Thank God he checked my eyes so often. In a routine check-up, he noticed a tiny tear in my retina. Because he did surgery the next day, my retina did not completely detach. But it would have within 48 hours, and I would have lost my vision in that eye. Not only is he a phenomenal surgeon, but he is al",Male

"He is not as caring and easy to talk to as he seems, he orders too many unnecessary testing don’t spend enough time to address questions and concerns and the second you disagree with his opinion he becomes offended and very short, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to see him",Male
I found him on accident but so glad I did! He delivered my son and will deliver any of my future babies . Very attentive and assuring. Great bedside manor. ,Male
"Horrible Ob/gyn. Do not put your health or your babys health in this man's hands. He really should retire. We saw him because he was the only one who could get us in right away. (He doesn't have many patients for, now, obvious reasons.) There are too many trusted Dr's out there to risk choosing this very socially awkward, creepy man. ",Male
"Dr. Uckele is the most compassionate, amazing doctor I have ever had.  I wish he could be my doctor for everything!  He truly listens and understands his patients, and does everything in his power to make sure you're comfortable and taken care of.  The staff here is equally as incredible and so sweet.  ",Male
"I don't think you could get a more caring, gentle and compassionate Dr as you can with Dr. Uckele. He makes sure to take the time with you to listen and go over everything. Having a bad day he will be sure to lighten your day. Ask any employee at the hospitals he is affiliated with and they have nothing but positive things to say. Highly recommended. ",Male
"Dr. Uckele always made my husband and I feel comfortable during the entire pregnancy and birth of our daughter.  I was very scared as a first time mom, and he made sure to take the time and answer any and all of my questions and was there for my entire labor and delivery (just so happened he was on call that day) and visited me the next day in the hospital.  Couldnt have asked for a better doctor. ",Male
"I would say i recommend dr Uckele to any women specially pregnent women.
 he is very kind person and  i felt relieve with him.his staff are kind, clean and organized too.  you can trust him specially if you have a sophisticated case like my case. i was in danger during the last trimester and he took care of me very well until i delivered my baby safely. i stayed in the hospital 6 days after the delivering and he check me every day twice. sometimes more.i would thank him very much",Male
Wait time is over 45min. Always running late therefore has no time to address concerns regarding my child. Requested referrals to address specific concerns and she never gives any. Request that i hold my child down to administer vaccinations because she is busy and has other patients waiting. Now refuses to surrender medical records and has been an ongoing dispute for over 6 weeks.,Female
"She is the best doctor, my kids loves her .",Female
She's a very professional. Any time She responds.  Thank you  Garfield need pediatric like you  J. Arangelova,Female
Dr Udall always spends a lot of time answering questions and listening to concerns. I highly recommend him as a doctor!,Male
Be careful of the care provided here by Dr. Udall.  Make sure to go to the Arizona Medical Board and search him for complaints.  What you find may be interesting.  One of the worst doctors I've ever seen. ,Male
"Dr. Udall doesn't spend much time with a patient, and doesn't follow up on concerns.  I called in about blood in my urine, and he said to drop by the office an leave a urine sample.  I did, and the medical asst. called back to say I had no bacteria in my urine.  No follow-up beyond that.  I called my daughter, who is a Nurse Practitioner, and she said I should see a Urologist, because blood in the urine can be serious, and the serious issues can't be ruled out without a cystoscopy and CT scan.",Male
I have been using Dr. Udall's services for 10 years. He is very honest and fair.,Male
Dr. Udall was fabulous!!! He and his staff were kind and very friendly! I would recommend them in anyone!,Male
"I saw him for ""maybe"" 5 minites. He did not review ANY of my medical history with me. He sat in a chair 5 ft. away and didn't look at my foot. I told him my symptoms &amp; that's how he made his diagnosis &amp; advised me that he cant do anything for me. For the money I spent, they should refund 75% because I got about 25% of his attention.",Male
"Terrible, horrible, avoid this Dr. and his clinic at all costs. I was referred to this Dr. by my primary care doc. I reserved the visit, was called the day before, a voice mail was left that my visit was cancelled due to an issue with my insurance. Needless to say, my insurance company was unaware of this issue, I spent over 3 hours on the phone with this clinic, bounced around from staff to staff, the practice managers, Jason and Mary, both promised to call me back, so far, never have and my appointment was never rescheduled. Never mind that my personal information was left on a public voice mail.",Male
Great doctor came in with a infected wound and he treated it and saw fast results and I’m more then thankful with him . 5 stars forsure,Male
Excellent!  I have seen him three times. I’ve seen him in Goodyear and Westgate.  I would travel to Mesa if I had to.  Thank god I don’t have to!!,Male
"I went to see Dr. Udall for a toenail issue. Without even doing anything on my toe or prescribing anything, he told me I was fine. Let alone I waited for him to show up for 40 minutes, but he billed me $304 for doing nothing!!!! Great disappointment! Do not go to this doctor, ever!",Male
"I was impressed with the office (new building), the fact that we got in to see the Dr. at our scheduled appointment time (no waiting) and the Dr. was very friendly and patient. Unfortunately, I've tried 3 times to schedule an appointment for another family member and have been put straight thru to ""hold"". I think the last time I gave it about 15 minutes of the worst music I've ever experienced before I hung up. Really liked the Dr....worst scheduling ever.",Male
Dr. Udall is a very caring and knowledgeable doctor. Have been fighting foot problems for several years and in just a couple of visits he has made my foot so much better. Would highly recommend. ,Male

"We placed on healthgrades


My daughter recently had an appointment and surgery on her knee. She has a discoid meniscus with a tear. From the moment Dr. Udall walked into the room for our appointment he had incredible bedside manner with my 12 year old. He talked to her, showed her films, drew a picture and explained the surgery in great detail.

Since her surgery, he gave us his cell phone number. Dr. Udall has answered all of our questions in a timely manner and has provided many solutions to help guide us. 

Saying thank you doesn’t even go far enough! Incredible orthopedic doctor!",Male
Relates extremely well to adults and children. Highly recommend,Male
"Dr. Udall has a fabulous way with children and their families. He is well-educated, thorough and extremely good at what he does. He is compassionate, sympathetic to his patients' needs and concerns and empathetic to their families. We have 3 children and Dr. Udall has treated all 3, performing surgery on 2. The procedures &amp; follow-up all went wonderfully. We - my husband, myself and all 3 of our children highly recommend Dr. Udall &amp; would not dream of going to anyone else!",Male
Dr. Udall has been our family doctor for more than 40 years. He is an excellent physician and has always provided exceptional care for our whole family.,Male
Dr Udall really listens ,Male
Dr. King Udall is a great Dr.! I’ve known him since I was a young child. He is very knowledgeable and very skilled. He was able to pull out a bullet from my back when I was shot. The ER left it in and it hurt laying on it. He was able to get it out very quick and I’m glad he did. If you want an experience Dr go see this man. He is great.,Male
"Dr. Udall is great!  He's timely and efficient and delivers excellent care. Wait times are short, and office is friendly and polite.",Male

"Dr. Udall is an excellent listener, and never makes me feel like he is in a hurry.  His broad knowledge of Family Medicine is excellent.  If there is anything out of his field of expertise, he is great to recommend a specialist.  Every specialist he has ever recommended to me has been an excellent choice.  He is especially good in the prevention of heart disease.  He has been on top of my husband's blood pressure and cholesterol levels which has yielded positive results.  ",Male
"Dr. Udall is an old fashioned doctor with horse sense.  He is kind, and he cares about my health.  He isn't afraid to help you with what you need, and unlike that horrible Dr. Romney the Younger, he treats you with respect, and takes his time with you.  I hope he never ever retires.",Male
Dr. Udall has taken care of our family for a very long time.  He has twice saved my life.  We consider him part of our family.  His skill and talents are tops. ,Male
"The entire visit was a fiasco from the start.  He didn’t want to be there and he let me know it.  He was more concerned about getting ready to leave for his 2 week adventure.
	He made me feel that my visit was a waste of his time and that all my health problems were my fault.  I had also requested to have an A1c completed while I was already there.  Nope – it took too much time.  When it was time to leave he said, sardonically, ""You can get out of here!"" So much more to write but not enough room",Male
Miscalculated serious prescription and incorrectly prescribed dosage. ,Female
Really thought he was great at first .  But once he found out I had PTSD he changed pulled my pain medication and anxiety medication stating I was a risk. I still go to him for everything els he is my primary doctor.,Male
Worst doctor I've seen. Long wait time didn't listen and would not prescribe meds that did work. Has to reinvent the wheel while you suffer for it. ,Male
"Dr Udani is wonderful  He changed my medication and I seem to have more movement and am feeling better.  Sleeping through the nite.  FINALLY.  Hubby is happier.  He was worried and so was I.  My insurance did not approve the cream he prescribed, but that is okay I just use the stuff I had.   Feeling better, it was worth the visit, for the arthritis.  Mine is painful that is a for sure.

Your Phone Number is disconnected and I cannot get through.  Please contact John Kiley,Male
"Its true, the patient who has been loyal to you for decades, has to wait 2-3 weeks to be seen. I don't think that scheduling through a hospital is the way to go. I think your staff knows your patients.  Which ones they see 1 a year because they need you, and which ones are trying to see your weekly because they are lonely.  Your staff can prioritize, where central scheduling can not.",Male
Dr. Udani is a great guy.  All my family members see him.  Cant ask for a better Doctor.,Male
"Dr. Udani is a good doctor, however his staff is not. Only bad thing about him is that he thinks that his staff is doing right thing and that is somebody else's fault if things go bad. To be more precise he recommended I do MRI . I went to schedule appointment for MRI and they told me that they need MD office to call them once they have my MRI approved by insurance. More then month later still nothing. Bad experience but this site doesn't let you write a whole story",Male
"Dr. you are so busy that you can't even respond  to my test for c- deff which I have been having for 3 weeks, I called 5 times to get the test, then called 4 times to get the results, finally at 7:30 they called to tell me I'm positive for c-deff .......do you know what it is like to go through this? Just think of going to a Chicago park with your kids and having to poop in the woods 2 times and pooping in your pants at Walmart, stracks ,tsc and 17 to 20 times  a day remember who you are",Male
Routine blood work daughter showed high results on two items.  Had to call his office twice to get an opinion.  Then his office called ordering new blood tests and ultrasound.  Had to call again for results.  He never called back and checked in.  Had well visit scheduled in July with e practitioner because he was booked till January.  She didn't look at file and asked about blood work. Then we I told her to check she said she was missing 2 shots.  After she got shots found out she already had 1.,Male

Very compassionate physician who is excellent in his field and has superb bedside manner.  Very eager to find and treat whatever medical condition you are experiencing. I definitely recommend him.,Male
"In my opinion his office just didn't get the job done. I have seen other Doctors for similar things and the other Doctors took care of them more effectively. Under no circumstance will I return to see this Doctors practice.  In fact , for most things I will only go to a major medical center. ",Male
Very personable and extraordinarily competent. I'd have no problem in recommending him to anyone in need.,Male
Dr. Udani is very knowledgeable about pulmonary disease. Most people who have the progressive lung disease that I have report that it took years for them to get an accurate diagnosis. Dr Udani was able to identify and diagnose my disease when he first took over my care. He is extremely compassionate and caring. He helps me to feel optimistic and less fearful as I look at my uncertain future.,Male

Very caring and good listener,Male
Phone check-up,Male
"He is an amazing, one-of-a-kind doctor who knows how to listen to his patient with caring, knowledge, intelligence, and understanding. He is a rare doctor who not only knows his medical specialty, but also knows how to explain clearly how the kidneys work, how they affect your body, and what you can do to keep them healthy. I wish all doctors had at least some of his outstanding qualities. I couldn't recommend him more highly. I am ninety years old, so I've seen many doctors over many years, and he is definitely in the top percentage of all of them.",Male

"I would recommend Dr. Udani to my family and friends. I was very nervous to be in a situation where I needed to see a Nephrologist, but Dr. Udani has been excellent! I never feel rushed at any of my appointments. He always takes the time to answer all of my questions and he explains everything so well. He has even went above and beyond by communicating with my other doctors. The extra compassion and collaboration separates Dr. Udani from other physicians I’ve seen in the past. ",Male
He is a very caring and excellent doctor. Listens to what you have to say. Calls you back when he says he will. He is always on top of things. Highly recommended. ,Male

"I had neck surgery last year by another surgeon that totally messed me up. I was in constant pain running down both of my arms. I saw Dr. Udani as my last hope after nothing was helping.

I finally feel like I've recovered from this problem and am eternally grateful to Dr. Udani.",Male

I am so happy he was available when I needed him and I would highly recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Udani is excellent!  I had a spinal cord stimulator implanted in my spine and I am very pleased with the results.  The pain reduction as a result of the stimulator allows me to be free of addicting opioid pain medications and has given me the freedom to lead a more normal life.

Dr. Udani took the time to review all my options and explained everything very clearly to me.  He is very friendly and understanding.  Great staff also.",Male
I could not be happier with the results of my surgery.  The office staff is welcoming and very friendly.  Dr. Udani's evaluation of your condition and explnation of options for treatment is very easy to understand.  The thoroughness of his attention to you is very genuine.  The minute I awoke from surgery my previous pain was totally gone and it is great to be back working out at the gym.,Male
"Dr. Udani was always extremely caring during all phases of my treatment and recovery. His level of skill is remarkable and I found him to be an outstanding surgeon and caregiver. Additionally, the level of care and concern by Dr. Udani's staff was also outstanding. The staff and assistants were compassionate, helpful, and efficient.

I see Carolyn and she doesn't really listen to me. She doesn't seem to know nearly enough to be a doctor. I get better results from the internet.,Male
Works in collaboration with local schools to get referrals and places all students on ADHD medications. He does not spend more than 1 minute with the child before making this determination and after speaking with several parents all the experiences were the same. It’s sad to think our children will be on unnecessary medications due to the collaboration with the local schools when they are not in need of them and expose them to possible side effects of medications they never needed.,Male
"I love Dr. Udasco and thank God for her.  She is one of the most sincerely attentive and compassionate psychiatrists I've had. She is a solid behavioral science professional who is very authentic, always appropriately-empathetic, objective, never judgmental and, treats comprehensively with knowledge from other medical specialties/social sciences.  This combo of qualities ranks her above her UBHC-peers and, makes her undeniably invaluable to the patient-community she treats. Thank you Dr. Udasco!",Female
Dr. Udasco is not a helpful doctor at all. She puts you down and wants to keep you down so she can make money off of you. She forces her values onto patients. She should be fired from her job. She isn't very knowledgeable either.,Female
"Dr VanArsdale is amazing. She listens, observes and offers nonjudgemental support. She's treated my family of four both individually and as a unit and the transformation has been remarkable. At first it was hard to let go of the mental health stigmas but we are so thankful for a new normal and the chance to put behind a lifetime of suffering. I highly recommend.",Female
I find that Dr. Vanarsdale has given me outstanding help through the time that I have seen her.  She quickly perceives my issues and gives me tools needed to move forward.  ,Female
Doctor Van Arsdale has been the perfect doctor for me for over ten years. I believe the only reason I survived this life is because of her help with my addiction to substances and my mood swings. She is very professional and she listens and understands. She never judged me. Every call she has made has been the right one. I suggest her to anyone struggling with addiction and mood issues.,Female
Under Dr. Van Arsdale's treatment I feel my life has improved tremendously! I am able to sleep soundly and have a better outlook on life. ,Female
Dr. Vanarsdale got me into her treatment within a week. I had serious problems with my medications from other doctors. She knew just what medications I needed and I have never felt better. She is easy to contact directly on her cell phone in between appointments. I wish I had gone to her 5 years earlier!,Female
Van Arsdale can't keep appointments straight she has no staff and is constantly messing up appointments and scheduling 2-4 patients at a time. Wait times are often well over 1 hour for a scheduled appointment. Not isolated either. I asked other patients and this is always the case. Very difficult to schedule appointments only to wait for three other people to be seen ahead of you. Waste. Of. Time.,Female
"Dr. Van Arsdale helped me out tremendously as a client. Then years later I went back with my then-husband and she worked with us both, and then again with me privately. She assisted me in that marriage to see that there was an organic condition he had which precluded us moving forward int he marriage. This was extremely helpful to me, and I am grateful to Dr. Van Arsdale for her excellent service to me over the years. Signed, Happy and Healthy",Female
"Very kind, patient and professional.   I feel like he genuinely cares about me.",Male
I found Dr. Vaaler after much research.  I found him to be very personable and easy to talk to.  He listened to my questions and I felt very comfortable with his prognosis.

Dr. Vaardahl has treated my entire family!  Very knowledgeable and professional!,Male

Very personable and knowledgeable!  Very highly recommended!!!,Male
"I was handed information regarding what a bunion and Taylor’s bunion is. I already knew this information, because I looked it up before I went to the doctor. Obviously, that’s why I made the appointment, to get further answers, suggestions to help, and or treatment. But no, that’s not what I got. Instead the answer I got was “ Not to sound rude, but I don’t care whether you get the surgery or not. That’s your decision, I just need to know what you want to do.” How does that help anyone?? I wouldn’t recommend Dr. Vaardahl at all, it was a waste of my time and money.",Male
"I met with Dr Vabi today for the first time to get consultation about the colonoscopy procedure. I'm 52 and never had one so I had a bit of anxiety about the unknown. Dr Vabi exuded a soothing bedside manner coupled with a great sense of humor that eventually eased my anxiety and gave me a sense of calmness. He also provided very good details about what to expect before, during, and after the procedure. My colonoscopy is scheduled in June and I can honestly say that i'm in good hands with Dr Vabi.",Male
"Dr Vabi has a wonderful bedside manor. While that sounds like nothing more than good manors, it's way more than that. He is a compassionate, skilled surgeon with a laid back vibe. He's an excellent listener. When he's with you, he's with you completely, not in a hurry to get to his next patient. Physicians hold our lives in their hands. Dr. Vabi takes this responsibility seriously, without arrogance. Knowledge is power. Do your research &amp; let Dr Vabi share his with you.",Male
Honestly I thought this doctor was arrogant with an ego about a mile high. When I told him I didn't want to take a certain medication because I felt that it wasn't helpful to me. He started puffing up his chest and telling me when I first came in I was psychotic when really I was overly exhausted from stress at work and dealing with a bad manager and I had trouble dealing with anxiety. This man is not very down to earth and makes assumptions and is very one sided in his views.,Male
"The office was very neat and clean, the staff was very helpful and pleasant and I didn't have to wait long for Dr. Vaca to see me. He was very professional and he genuinely cared for my well being. He takes his time to know more about my health and his recommendations healed me in no time. Highly recommend him.",Male
Not a long wait and excellent service from the doctor and staff.,Male
"I would encourage anyone seeking attention to detail, perfectionism and tact to see Dr. Vaca. The process from beginning to end was smooth, at ease, well informed and last but most importantly exquisitely executed. I’ll continue to visit his practice and refer him to anyone I know.",Male
Dr. Vaca is incredible. He has an outstanding quality of medical care. I got my lips done with him for the first time ever and I can say that I am extremely happy with the results. He took his time and listened to what I wanted and then explained everything to detail. I immediately felt at ease and confident in my receiving expert medical care. ,Male
He is very intelligent and wants to treat your health issues,Male
"As a surgeon, I can't find words to express how terrible the office treats patients.  I routinely wait with my elderly parents for up to 3 hours in the office waiting room before ever being taken to an exam room.  It is a challenge to get a 95y/o to the physician and to have the office treat us like we can just drop in whenever and wait is incredulous.  Also, with advanced Alzheimer's, he does not acknowledge the inability of maintaining care at home, continuing to assert that the patient is not ready for full time care.  Dr. Vacalis was recommended by Dr Letts (cardiologist) probably because at the time, he was one of the few physicians accepting new patients.  Now, trying to secure care is a nightmare.",Male
"I’ be rated this office before and after discussing all the office issues with the office manager I stuck around hoping for change. Two years later and the office staff is as incompetent as ever. They put you on hold for up to 15 minutes just to make an appointment. The billing is terrible, inaccurate and slow. I left a message for the nurse about my child and my call wasn’t returned until over 48 hours later. After two trips to urgent care. The Dr. Is fine but staff it awful.",Male
"i have to say that this ""doctor"" is horrible. He had my mother in law so overmedicated she was having dementia and unable to get off the couch. For a severe sinus infection he told her she only had allergies.  he was treating for high blood pressure which she does not have!!!  had her on blood pressure meds. it is so fortunate we got her away from him and to a real doctor when we did. she'd probably be in a nursing home or dead had she continued to go to him.  ",Male
 He will listen to you. He is very friendly.,Male
"I saw this doctor. Was told i had to live with the pain and dizzyness i was having. I changed doctors now i am scheduled for a cardiac catheterization in 2 days. Here one of my main arteries has a large blockage. This doctor just didn't care. Terrible, terrible doctor.",Male
I would never recommend this person he wouldn’t even let me speak he has 0 compassion,Male
"Dr Vacante addressed my symptoms by changing a medication I was taking that had been prescribed by another physician I saw.  This made a huge difference in how I felt and it was likely that I was having an adverse reaction to the original medication, so my symptoms would not have improved without Dr Vacante making this change.  Dr Vacante is a very smart doctor who is very good at diagnosing problems, and an excellent cardiologist that will take great care of your heart. I recommend him.",Male
"PCP sends me to the ER, turns out it's CHF. Meet Dr. Vacante while I was in the hospital, apparently he was assigned to me. Aftger dealing with him and North Ohio Heart for the past 7 months, I can say that this man is possibly the worst cardiologist in that group. He has terrible bedside manners and treats you as if you're wasting his time. Comes in the room, sees how you're doing, dosn't like you asking follow up questions and gets defensive if you try to argue on behalf of yourself.",Male
"Rudeness should be his specialty!  Spends the least amount of time possible with you , tells you absolutely nothing, acts if he could care less if you live or die! Bedside manner is absolutely terrible!  Please find a different doctor before you see him!!!!",Male
He did not listen to concerns; refused to complete a prior authorization for a medication he prescribed; refused to consult with a primary care physician within his own medical group,Male
Doctor Vicanti diagnosed me with a rare heart condition that half dozen other doctors missed prior to him. He acted fast and was very invested into my care. Chances are Dr. Vicanti saved my life. I can not say enough good things about him. He gave me a life again. If I could give 100 stars I would.,Male
"One of the caring  physicians I have ever been to. Office staff as well.
 ",Male
If you want a doctor that will engage in appropriate behavior and destroy a family...he’s definitely the one! Wouldn’t trust him with a goat! Redneck’s sister,Male
It was the worse I ever experienced. He has no bedside manners and treats the nurses terrible. I would never let him treat my dog.,Male
Wonderful. He figured out my problem immediately after MANY Doctors had no clue!,Male
Best Doctor I ever worked with,Male
Wonderful and very thorough. Will never go to another pulmonologist. ,Male
the best there is.,Male
"Dr. Vacca did an excellent job of listening to my problem, running some tests and discussing a range of possible treatments.  I was completely satisfied with the visit.",Male
Dr. Vacca cured the sciatica I experienced in both legs and hips.  I would highly recommended him.,Male
"
Dr. Vacca didn’t sugar coat things. I like that he explained the procedure and answered questions, but didn’t waste time trying to coddle me. He was friendly and had a great manor, but I want to know what’s going to happen, not sit there with someone trying to make it sound better than it is. He was great!",Male
Dr took time to explain my options and what they entailed. I appreciated his  forthright manner and curtesy.,Male
"I saw Dr.Vacca for a second opinion for my back issues. He took the time to listen and explain what was going on. Even though he couldn't fix my issues which are soft tissue and ortho related, he provided me with referrals to doctors that maybe able to help. He didn't say "" Sorry I can't help you have a nice day"" which I have heard so many times over 9 years he said I may not be able to help but let's find you someone that can. I was looking for answers and I found them with my visit to Dr. Vacca.  His staff are very friendly.  It is a very welcoming environment. Thank Dr. Vacca and staff. I came with questions and left with answers!",Male
I was hesitant to have a back surgery so I asked my doctor about Dr Vacca his answer was if I need a back surgery I would let Dr Vacca do it and yes Dr Vacca fixed my stenosis because my left shoulder was lower than my right one also fixed my sciatica in both legs and put rods and cage on l2 and l3 30 days after the operation I am walking and getting up without pain and every day I feel better and stronger thank you Dr Vacca I truly recommend him,Male
"I went to see Dr. Vacca after another ""Surgeon"" told my my issue was not spine related which IT WAS. He was very honest and straight forward which I feel some people would take as uncaring but I can assure you HE CARES. He has always answered my questions and made sure I had the best care. He and his staff have been helpful and always work hard to get me out of the pain I am in.",Male
"The first time I had Dr Vacca work on my back was to correct and finish work I had done to my back by another ""Surgeon"". That was years ago and now I need a tune up to the work done back then, which should last me the rest of my life. Life with pain is NO life!",Male
I was seen before I even sat down and after the Nurse left Dr. Vacca was at the door in maybe a minute or two,Male
Dr. Vacca was amazing and I can’t thank him enough for giving me my life back.  I was extremely nervous about having surgery but the whole process couldn’t have gone smoother and he made sure to let me know what to expect. He made me and my family super comfortable and explained everything to us throughly. I highly recommend him!,Male
"Our experience to obtain an appointment, get neurosurgeon assigned and see Dr Vacca was a very disappointing one. The clinic staff was NOT interested in assisting us, it took great amount of persistence and numerous calls to get our appointment for a severe tri- level cervical condition. We traveled 2 1/2 hour( one-way) for the appointment and had a feeling that Dr Vacca had no interest in offering the fast, most effective solution for my husband's condition because he was more conserved about.",Male
Dr Vacca performed a back operation and I was pleased.... He is the best in the west.... in all ways he is the best.... I would never see another doctor again..,Male
"I had C3-C7 replacement. With bone spurs pressing into spinal column. Dr Vacca explained clearly what was wrong, what needed to be done and how it would fix my neck pain. At surgery he had a Nerve specialist there and my surgery was done as planned. It takes awhile to heal, but Dr Vacca was wonderful at post-op appts and I am so thankful for his abilities. A friend took me to Dr Vacca for a second opinion.  If I had done what original surgeon suggested, I would have been in a world of hurt.",Male
"Staff and the office is ok. The Dr not so much, he doesn't listen and doesn't do any test unless it's need for surgery. Never will I recommend him to anyone ",Male
"I have seen him for a few months because the other doctor left the practice. He doesn't respond to emails.  If I have a question, I don't trust he will get back to me. I'm going to try a different doctor in another site.",Male
"I have been a patient of Josephs  for 19 years he has seen me thru a lot of really bad things/  now i have to get a new dr because they are no longer filing my insurance,   i have really been upset over this",Male
"Dr Vaccarella has been my Dr for many years. In my book he the best. I always feel like I am in good hands. He is thorough, he always is willing to listen and very caring. Because of him, his staff and Dr Carmen I am blessed to be a Cancer Survivor.I will be forever greatfull.",Male
AS a Family Practitioner I find him very thorough and friendly.  He takes the time to explain conditions and will attempts to squeeze you in without a regular appointment.  I've never had to wait more than 30 mins (1X) with the norm being 10 - 15.  Would recommend him.,Male
"I waited an hour in his office to be seen today. When i displayed my frustration for waiting, he advised me there were other patients ahead of me. I understand that however; he was chatting with his staff about the pending snow for 20 minutes! He was rude and made my appt as quick as possible while engaging more with his other patients. I will not return and taking my family to another physician. I have never felt so belittled by a doctor in my life.",Male
"Dr. Vaccarello is the best in the business.  Excellent surgeon with outstanding results in a tough high mortality area of ovarian cancer. He is kind, compassionate and realistic.
I appreciate his skills as a surgeon and compassion.",Male
"Dr Vaccarello saved my life with nearly stage 4 uterine cancer. He did a hysterectomy and made sure all areas were clear of cancer cells. I had cancer return to my neck area which he took care of with oral medication. I am nearly 5 years out as a survivor. He is very good at what he does and the years of experience speak volumes. So after chemo and radiology, I would recommend him in a heartbeat.",Male
My mother was recommended to Dr. Vaccarello by her local OBGYN to have a hysterectomy because of heart conditions and her chances of having cancer. Dr. Vaccarello was extremely rude and his bedside manner was terrible. Because my mother did not have Cancer he did not want to help her. She was in the hospital for 3 days because of excessive bleeding and clotting. The hospital had to give her 3 units of blood because she lost so much blood. Yet he did not find this important enough for his time.,Male
Best doctor ever.  I've never had a doctor like him.  I wish all doctors could be so good at what they do and show as much kindness.,Male
Dr Vaccarello did my Ovarian Cancer surgery I believe he is the best Dr ever. Explains everything in detail. I would recommend him to everyone. I would pick him over any other Dr. If I should ever have another issue I certainly hope I can have him as my Dr. If I would need another Dr if he doesn’t do certain parts of the body I would consult with him for a recommendation..,Male
"Dr. Vaccarello has been a huge relief for me and the best doctor that I have had during my journey with cancer at a young age. I have had several surgeries over the past two years and he has by far performed the best surgery. I barely had pain after a hysterectomy. I only needed pain medication for 2 days. He is very compassionate and understanding. I would never go anywhere else. The staff at this facility is also amazing,second to none!! As many of them are survivors themselves.",Male
"Office staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. I am a nurse administrator and if any of the employees that work under me treated people the way that the staff in this office does, I would fire them on the spot. Their records are incomplete. They are extremely inattentive as well. We will be going to see a different doctor from now on. If I was able to leave a 0 star rating, I would!",Female
This office has a lack of professionalism. When your a professional you Dont display at home behavioral towards a 14 year. The new itch Colette is the worst. Im glad to no longer be there. I have a feeling she and the doctor and staff will fallout with each other.,Female
"Staff is very unfriendly, Spanish woman at the front desk was very nasty to me, left without being seen. Office is old, needs updating. If that woman worked in the medical office I worked in, she would have been fired on the spot for her attitude and the way she treats patients. Without patients there is no practice. Would never recommend someone to go there and be treated as rudely as i was. ",Female
Dr. Vaccarezza determined my issue and took action which stabilized the situation. Not much fanfare or a slew of medicines and tests. However an accurate assessment of situation from the get go. ,Male
"Dr Vaccari is professional , knowledgeable, compassionate, informative, eager to ensure the best medical plan for her patients and brilliant??
Linda??",Female
She did not read my chart at all! She comes off as friendly but dismissed my concerns and does not pay attention to important details to the point where it truly impacts her ability to properly treat a patient. I saw a specialist later and they were shocked that she had completely dismissed these concerns!,Female
She is a cute little Doctor! Oh and very smart!!! She always get back to me quickly when I need her. I like her!,Female
"I absolutely love dr. Vaccari. She is very attentive, and listens carefully to my needs. She has absolutely helped me turn my health around, with my complications of diabetes. I trust her judgment and her decisions because she speaks about it with me in detail to help me understand where we should be in reference to my diabetic issues. She will be my doctor for the rest of my life, and that in itself should say a lot about her.  The staff there are very friendly and extremely helpful.",Female
I have seen this Doctor once. My mother has seen her for about a year. This Doctor and her staff are horrible. They don’t return calls. They don’t fill medications in a timely manner. She also spoke to me about going off a medication and then would not prescribe and left me cold without a prescription. My 86 year old mother is also under her care. I do not and would not ever recommend this Doctor or their staff.,Female
"I did an annual physical exam with Dr. Vaccari. The doctor herself is very nice, however, she recommended me to some lab tests which per her search should be covered by my insurance. Later, the hospital billed me for the additional lab tests and claimed that they are not covered by the insurance. And I tried to contact the billing department to argue about the unexpected billing. Their attitude was very mean and had no patience. I will never ever visit this doctor again!",Female
"Dr. Vaccari is one time, efficient, warm, understanding and really listens to her patients! This was my first visit to Scripps and everyone made me feel like a VIP, even though I am just a normal everyday person! Great job Dr. Vaccari and Scripps!",Female
Scheduling was very easy and quick. She listened to my concerns and was very through. She was very informative and addressed every concern and explained her thoughts and future concerns and procedures. I highly recommend Dr. vaccari to anyone looking for a primary care physician. ,Female
"Easy to talk to... Understands woman's issues. Is difficult to manage appointments . Ear infection: not available...for three days! 
Also, put on hold for more than 5 minutes.",Female
"Office setting very relaxed nice touch with classical music playing in background, amiable and open to queries to weight lose. My wife and I are his patients and we are very satisfied and slowly meeting our weight lose goals.",Male
"Dr. Vaccariello was extremely rude! Never have I met someone, especially a doctor, that spoke the way he did. He said you're not doing much to help with your weight. Told me I weighed more than it said in my chart, which was unreal, because the girl had just weighed me..after all of this, maybe ten minutes in his office, he told me there was nothing he could do, and sent me on my way..waste of $200.",Male
"Every aspect of my experience with the rothman team and Jefferson hospital was a first class and genuine patient experience.   Dr Vaccaro was able to assess my problem area and develop a treatment plan while providing me with a sense of hope for a back condition that I have struggled with for over 25 years.  Working in healthcare my self and having received significant medical treatment as a child for unrelated conditions, I know what having the confidence in a provider and quality healthcare is all about.  Thank you again Dr. Vaccaro and team.",Male
"very pleasant, but fast, have your questions ready. 
Workmans comp injury, very understanding and compassionate.
My survery was scheduled fast, the hospital was fantastic, recovery as to be expected with cervical fusion, after care was great! ",Male
"Dr. Vacarro operated on my spine twice. I was beyond lucky to have him as my surgeon. Beyond being the highly brilliant surgeon that he is, he is also funny, calming and truly cares about you. He’s the very best! Tara",Male
"Dr. Vacarro is down to earth and easy to talk to and understand.  He talks with you, not at you.  His demeanor instantly sets you at ease.  My surgery went very well and the follow up was great.",Male
"From the moment I walked into Rothman, I was greeted with smiles, professionalism and the entire team was so helpful and kind.  Dr Vaccaro was very knowledgeable, professional and humble.  He did not rush through our visit.  He took the time to answer any questions I had. He took the time to explained my films, surgical vs non surgical options and ""if he were in my shoes"" what/how he would proceed.  He was not pushy of his opinion.  He is highly educated, motivated and eager to continue to learn.  His fellow, PA-C, nurse were also very professional and easy to converse with especially since no one could come in during your visit as a second set of ears because of COVID. I had a few questions once the PA-C left and he quickly came back in and sat down without making me feel rushed or inconvenienced.  I would highly recommend Dr Vaccaro and his team on all levels.",Male
The absolute best. Saved me from years of lower back pain. His expertise is very apparent. He knew what was wrong me with me after one look of my mri!,Male
Best surgeon. I would recommend Dr Vaccaro to anyone needing back surgery. He treats you and your guests like family. I’d give 10 stars if I could.,Male
He is very thorough and really cares about his patients.  He allowed my husband to walk pain free again. He is a good sent. I would recommend him over and over to anyone.,Male
"Saying Dr. Vaccaro is the best is the biggest understatement there can be!  He is kind, and listens to your concerns.  In the operating room he performs miracles!  There is no other doctor that I would consider for surgery!!!",Male
"Had two herniated discs and tried everything before getting surgery, but if I had known how great I would feel I would have gotten the procedure done earlier.  Great doctor.  Was very helpful in providing information through the surgery process. Feel 100x better now.",Male
struggled with lower back pain for a year. tried everything to help with the pain nothing worked. seen dr. vaccaro fixed the problem the pain was gone.,Male
"Dr, Vaccaro has given my life back to me.  I was grateful that he took me on as  a patient.  I am more grateful that he successfully operated on me on three separate occasions.  Back surgery (lumbar) twice and neck (cervical) surgery.  Entering my 65th year, he has made me ambulatory and active with no restrictions.  Although I still am recuperating with physical therapy as I write this review, I am certain I will return to full activities, pain free within a short time.  He and his staff took an extraordinary amount of time with me pre-surgery and post-op.  I cannot express my gratitude enough, except to say that I hope a reader of this review absorbs these words, in helping him or her in making the decision to move forward in their surgical decision without hesitation.  Leave it in Dr. Vaccaro's hands, literally, and you will have no regrets.  Thank you Dr. Vaccaro and Staff.

My visit was awesome like visiting family. Welcomed with open arms. Dr. Vaccaro and his team are very professional and caring people. Would highly recommend Dr. Vaccaro and the members at Jefferson at Methodist hospital.,Male
"I can not say enough great things about Dr. Vaccaro and his team. Dr. Vaccaro gave me back my quality of life. I had terrible pain down my leg, my foot was totally numb, I could not stand erect or walk without a limp. Dr. Vaccaro saw me 2 days after I called his office for the first time. He diagnosed my issues quickly, clearly explained my options and performed surgery 8 days after I initially saw him. Surgery resolved all my issues immediately. I have never visited a doctor's office that was as prompt and caring as was Dr. Vaccaro's.  I never waited past my scheduled appointment time.",Male
"Horrible I would never never recommend this man to anyone 
you visit him at your own risk. You'll need luck",Male
"I was suffering for debilitating pain down the back of both legs.  I was prescribed steroids, PT, etc and my condition only worsened.  I went to see Dr. Vaccaro who ordered an MRI and saw that I needed lumbar spinal fusion.  I had the surgery and never experienced any pain following the surgery and did not require any pain medication!  Within four weeks I was walking 2 miles a day with absolutely no pain!  I am now walking 3 miles a day!  Dr. Vaccaro is truly a gifted surgeon and I can never thank him enough for giving me back my life!",Male
Dr. Vaccaro is an EXCELLENT SURGEON.  He performed a spinal operation on me and really did an excellent job.  I would recommend him to anyone.  He is easy to talk with and listens to his patients.  Thank you to Dr. Alexander Vaccaro.,Male

IM FOREVER GREATFUL !!!
HE IS SUPER DOWN TO EARTH , TALK TO HIM ABOUT ANYTHING, 
THANKS DR VACCARO  LOVE YA BUDDY LOL",Male
"Dr.  Vaccaro performed TLIF lumbar fusion on me last December, and he was nothing short of amazing. Great and caring Dr. from my 1st exam visit, through the surgery and my final exam visit this past August. He's very thorough in reviewing your symptoms and pain, and clearly spells out what he can do to alleviate those issues. Great ""bedside manner"" too, and just a really interesting and intelligent individual. Has a great team with Christy R, his P.A., and Kerry L., his scheduler. Christie an Kerry were invaluable when I had to postpone my back surgery due to another surgery that needed to be done quickly, and they went out of their way to fit me in with Dr. Vaccaro before the holidays. I would recommend Dr. Vaccaro and his team to anyone with back pain and related issues.",Male
I was able to get an appointment very quickly.  I was greeted upon arrival and checked in in a timely manner.  My appointment was on schedule with very little waiting.  Dr. Vaccaro and his team were all extremely knowledgeable and very kind and professional.,Male
Hey Tony this is your prayer partner who helped you liquidate the store! Just wondering how you've been? I'm sure you are busy but still respect that you allowed me to pray for you during those days! Sue and i just celebrated our 21st anniversary!,Male
"My 83-year-old father had a horrible experience with this doctor. He was being treated for a very serious case of skin cancer and Dr. Vaccaro's inattention to basic health conditions such as dehydration and high blood pressure (not to mention the fact that my father couldn't swallow due to the radiation) put my father in the hospital for 16 days. It is amazing to me, the lack of care my father received, to the point that he had to insist on being admitted to the hospital himself. Such poor care!",Male
"I have been a patient of Dr Vaccaro for nearly 40 years, and he is probably the best internist I have ever had.  He is thorough in his examinations, accurate in his diagnosis, and also quite personable.",Male
Dr. Vaccaro has diagnosed and cured serious health issues for me which were missed by other doctors.   I have total confidence in his judgment.,Male
"Avoid this guy at all costs. Rude, dismissive and completely uninterested. Paid no attention to what I was saying and condescended at every opportunity. I left not receiving the help I needed and was rushed out the door. It was though I was inconveniencing him. Received ten times better service from the receptionist. Someone needs to revoke his license.",Male
"Dr. Vaccaro is EXCELLENT!!! 
Went way above his call to duty to ensure that we understood everything and was very incredibly thorough and caring. 

We are so incredibly lucky to have found him!",Male
"Dr. Vaccaro is horrendous! Not only is his bedside manner poor, but he is the doctor that tells his patients the extreme worse case scenario. How does he get away with predicting awful news upon first meeting someone?
Within minutes he was using my history to tell me worse case of all of my concerns (ex: I have a bad heart murmur, would need a procedure for high iron and insulted my recent weight gain). All to get tested and have everything come back 100% fine. I don't even have a heart murmur..",Male
"Dr. Vaccaro listens, advises and is proactive in prevention.  He is personable and I feel very comfortable having him as my primary caregiver.",Male
I would not recommend him. He was condescending and rude throughout the visit.,Male
Went to OCLI and saw this doctor because I was having blurred vision along with other neurological symptoms. She spent less than 3 minutes with me and told me I had eye allergies and gave me 3 different eyedrops. Completely ignored the other symptoms and left before I could even say anything. I went to a neurologist and was diagnosed with MS.,Female
Dr. Vacarro is the best eye specialist my husband and I have ever had. My husband has glaucoma and I have narrow angle glaucoma. She sent me to another eye specialist for another issue and he is excellent as well.  She has taken cataract out of our eyes without any issues. I have recommended her to others and always will.,Female
Dr. Vaccaro completely misdiagnosed my diplopia and referred me to the wrong type of specialist. She spent about 5 minutes with me and I felt like she couldn't get rid of me fast enough! The whole experience at OCLI made me feel like I was on a human assembly line. I received more help for the double vision from my primary care physician and am now seeing a neuro opthamologist five months later than I should have. OCLI was a complete waste of time and money!,Female
She was very professional knew what she was doing made me feel very comfortable great experience will always go back.,Female
Amazing visit. Extremely knowledgeable and precise. ,Female
He was very professional and had a caring attitude. Great bedside manner. He actually listened to my concerns and didn't just brush them off. He did a thorough exam,Male
Great expertise diagnostically. Has a great personality and terrific bedside manner. Connects well and explains things well to patients. Encourages questions to make sure that one understands what he is saying.,Male
"I made my first appointment for a physical and once I was there, she said it wasn't a physical but an ""introductory appointment"" and that I would have to return to get an annual exam (still paid a copay). I told her I would be traveling out of the country and she asked me which vaccines I needed. She was awkward when discussing one of my chronic conditions and seemed judgmental. She was a very nice, sweet, friendly person but as a provider made me feel somewhat uncomfortable.",Female
"Dr. Vaccaro is terrific.  She is a great patient advocate -- one who will go to bat for the right test, medication, therapy, etc.  Her approach is laid back and respectful; she takes the time to listen to her patients' fears and concerns, approaches others as competent partners in the diagnosis and treatment of illness, and develops an interest in the whole person.  Dr. Vaccaro is an extremely smart and thorough doctor in whose care I feel very safe and very confident.  We are lucky to have her.",Female
"Seems to be knowledgeable, however, that is fully eclipsed by her and her staff indifference and lack of coordination and care.

Two examples: 

1. After prescribing a CT scan, has not followed with a liver cancer patient (my brother) for 2 weeks.  The scan showed cancer has progressed and his medication still were no longer working.  He was left essentially without treatment for two weeks while cancer was out of control.

2. She refused to provide any direction for him getting into a trial",Female
"Very poor in knowledge, does not care about her patient at all. Take forever to make decisions while cancer can grow rapidly. Patient could die because of poor symptom control, careless oncologist., delayed treatment, bad decisions. It is evil to recommend this doctor to anyone. It is even worse that her wait time is horribly long. She deserves no star if no negative star.",Female
"Excellent Doctor I can not say enough.
He is the best Urologist  I have seen in years.
Caring and bed side manners are excellent.
I highly recommend Dr. Vaccaro.  His expertise in urology can not be compared.

Sincerely

"Terrible experience. Would never come back to see this Dr. again nor would recommend any patient to see him. Extremely rude!! When asked if he recommends that I start taking medicine for high blood pressure (mind you I had a stroke), he told me that he was a neurologist, and that even if I needed it, he wouldn't be the one prescribing it. Seemed like he was mad at the world. Terrible, terrible, terrible doctor. Time to retire if you can't treat your patients with the least respect.",Male
"I just had an appointment with Dr. Vaccaro this morning and can’t praise him and his staff enough!!  He is kind, thorough, spent time with me and listened. He even answered a few questions from my daughter who was with me!  The staff is marvelous too!  Recommend him highly. For the very few who left negative comments I cannot imagine what you are talking about!!!!",Male
Doctor is great but his front desk girl in the Clifton building is terribly rude. I would not return because of her. ,Male
"Dr. Vaccaro was a consultant when my 82 y.o. father was admitted to the hospital with an acute altered mental status. He was not able to make a definitive diagnosis, based on the initial tests, he was respectful and open to feed back.",Male
"Lacks bedside manner. After my MRI without contrast, Dr. Vaccaro called me on my phone to deliver news of me having an acoustic neuroma. If he talked with me in his office with the paperwork I would have seen the radiologist note that it was only possible. It was a very stressful time. I believe all doctors should talk in person about anything that is not normal. I am trying to take this as a positive experience and be thankful I did not have an acoustic neuroma after having my contrast MRI. ",Male
"Dr. Vaccaro charged me $14,000 to put about 10 stitches on my son's face.  Truly unbelievable.",Male
"Dr. Vaccaro is a kind and caring Doctor. Something that is rare these days. He diagnosed a vascular problem that had baffled at least 6 previous doctors of differing specialties. He performed surgery , successfully fixed the issue and improved my quality of life tremendously.  I would and have recommended him to others with vascular issues.",Male
"
I had a very productive and informative consultation with Dr. Vaccaro. He took the time to answer any and all the questions  that I had. I am very satisfied with the visit.",Male
"We've been taking our children to Dr. Vaccaro for 17 years. I recommend him to everyone with children.  He's extremely knowledgeable, but even more important to me is that he LISTENS to all my concerns, every time.  He explains throughly and patiently, and now that the boys are old enough, he explains to them as well.  I cannot say enough about how lucky we feel to have had Dr. Vaccaro help us raise our boys!!",Male
Dr. Vaccaro is extremely knowledgeable about childhood conditions.  He is up to date on the latest medical research and often cites it during visits.  I completely trust his medical advice for both of my children.  I refer all of my family and friends to Dr. Vaccaro specifically.,Male
"I have used Dr. Vaccaro for years now for the usual range of problems that people with fair skin have in Southern California. He is efficient. His staff is polite. I feel like I have his full, undivided attention during the consultation. And he gets me in and out, with minimal wait times. They have my insurance and other transaction details ready to go before I reach the desk.  I recommend him without reservation.",Male
An excellent doctor. Solid staff. Nice man.,Male
His office staff is efficient and Dr. Vaccaro is personable and professional.,Male
"Dr. Vacek is very professional. He has been our family doctor since he started his practice. He is kind, compassionate, caring and has a wonderful bedside manner.
He has always been accurate with his diagnosis and is very knowledgeable, giving you several options.  Our family would highly recommend him.",Male
"My visit with this doctor was not fruitful. I felt that my concerns were largely brushed off, and I was guided to specific medical products for something that was quickly diagnosed (no testing).
I had indicated that I was feeling depressed on the ""yes/no"" questionnaire, but the nurse that went over these questions with me dissuaded my indication by claiming they meant major depression, such as not being able to get off the couch, not finding joy in anything, etc.",Male
"Dr. Vacek was my doctor in the emergency room. From the moment he introduced himself, he was easy to talk to and listened earnestly to me so I could give a full explanation of what was going on. He took my concerns seriously and communicated well.
He was thorough in investigating the cause of my symptoms, and worked swiftly to complete the necessary tests and treatment to get me feeling better as soon as possible. 
He has a kind bedside manner and it was obvious to me that he truly empathizes and cares about his patients.",Male
Always gives thoughtful consideration to any problem. Has been proactive if lab work or ct scan will clear up questions but has given option of waiting also.,Male
My family and I love Dr Vacek. We’ve been blessed to have gotten a dr here in Glen Rose Like him . He sits with you as long As you  need and doesn’t make you feel rushed so he can get to the next patient. He’s very knowledgeable about anything you ask him.   He’s a dr that cares for and about his patients as people . We definitely don’t want to go to anyone else . Hope Dr Vacek stays in Glen Rose forever!!!!!!,Male
"When I was a patient of Dr. Vacek, he ordered a Cologard test in lieu of a colonoscopy that was not covered by my insurance.  I now have to pay a bill for  $650.",Male
"I went to see Dr. Vacek about a sinus infection.  He prescribed an antibiotic that the pharmacist found to have an interaction with one of my heart medications.  The pharmacist called Dr. Vacek for a recommendation for another medication.  I left multiple messages with Dr. Vacek with no reply.  After two days passed, the nurse called and said that Dr. Vacek stated that if I had a problem with a drug interaction then I could take half the dose of the antibiotic.  Super bad medicine!",Male
"Dr. Vacek is caring, thorough, and knowledgeable.  He put my concerns at ease, and is following up to ensure my health.  ",Male

"She will dismiss your pain, not willing to prescribe pain meds. I am not an addict, nor on a ""list"". I am suffering in pain due to a pinched nerve in the neck, and she even stated she didn't have a clue what was wrong initially. A physician should never say they don't know. She showed me she doesn't care, was very short, not personable, and odd. I have taken this personal as the pain is so severe, and offended as if I was a problem pill popping patient. DO NOT GO TO HER IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PAIN! NOT CONFIDENT IN HER ABILITIES.",Female
"Just met Dr Vachani  today.  I found him to be straight forward, caring, and spoke to my 80 year old father with compassion. Hence, being in the health care field I know how patients  find that the Empathy is missing. 
Dr Vachani is far and above professional and empathetic. 
Which is a vow one takes when working in the health care field.
Just would like to thank  Dr. Vachani,   as I know my Pop's prognosis is more than likely, not what I want to hear.  I feel comfortable with him in your hands!",Male
She was extremely responsive to my needs and one of the only doctors who was clear with me about my treatment plan and truly felt like they cared about me.,Female
"""Dr. Rachot"" (Vacharothone) runs Medallus Medical, a health membership practice. Joining it is the smartest health care move I've made. My diabetes PA has 37 years' experience and was great to work with: knowledgeable, no nonsense, and super friendly. I'm glad I found this place. The Affordable Care Act isn't so affordable for me. A year's membership at Medallus, entitling me to see a doc for $10 as often as needed, cost me less than one-fifth of what I paid for a single ER visit last month.",Male

"Terrible bedside manner, very inpatient, very matter of fact. She makes the patient feel like their concerns are exaggerated and unimportant, her treatment plan is based on what she thinks the insurance will cover. If your looking for a doctor that has compassion and concern, and will research your symptoms and work with you to find a diagnosis instead of rushing you out of their office because they have lost their passion for medicine, Dr. Vachani is not recommended.",Female
"Intelligent,Knowledgeable,attentive,attractive,detailed",Female
I have been in search for a PCP for nearly 8 months and I found Dr. Vachhani. She is a good listener and and speaks clearly. At my first appointment she spent an ample amount of time with me and it was a smooth visit from the waiting area to checking in to seeing her. Great Job!,Female
Dr. Vachhani is very efficient and accurately diagnoses  and treats accordingly.  She also takes the time  to genuinely address all of your concerns.,Female
"Went to see Dr. Vacchani for the first time and was very pleased with her. However, her nurse has been outstandingly rude to me when talking about my concerns over the phone or the mychart messaging. Very displeased with her I don’t even want to return.",Female

"Dr. Vachanni has been my Dr., for many years. I've always liked him and think he does a good job.
The last time I saw him, I was having extreme pain down my leg and in my hip. The pain was bad enough, I couldn't walk, or even stand for more than a couple minutes. The pain had increased for a few weeks. I went to him, explained the course of events up to that time. 
I expected he would refer me to someone who could determine the cause and what could be done to help me get better. I am an active person who can now hardly get around.
He told me to lift my leg to the front and to the side and said ""THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU"". I was shocked, I am still in disbelief. 
He told me to take ibuprofen and offered me a prescription for it.",Male
"This was my elderly mom’s doctor. When asked to provide a notarized letter of her condition, he refused to have it notarized. This was after my husband and I drove 2 hours and got a notary to meet us at his office.",Male

Rude and acted as if having him as a doctor was a privilege. Will not let you talk and he will presume what you are saying and as a result you will not have a productive progress in your health care. He will also don't hold his tongue and insult you. Do not trust him. ,Male
I would NOT recommend Dr Vachanni to ever again. I trusted Dr until the day I ended up with a protruded disc in neck and went to ER then was told to see primary Dr. His main lady in front was rude and when I was finally there to seek treatment for the severe pain I was in Dr came in exam room angry and after yelling at me and stating I was a high risk patient threw me out of his office. I was in such severe pain I ended up back in the hospital for 6 days for other Dr's to treat me. Disappointed!,Male

It is totally unacceptable,plus diet day before, whole preparation  and costly med",Male
"This guy's arrogance astounds me! He treats his patients like they are less than human, beneath him. I had a recent stay in the hospital that could have been a lot shorter but I was waiting around on him to see me. He kept telling the nursing staff that he would be there at a certain time and then wouldn't show up and then they would call him and remind him and then he would say he would show up then but wouldn't. I finally got so sick that they discharged me to refer me to another gi doctor. ",Male

After he walked out the room nurse apologized &amp; said he’s always like that.",Male
"If there was a -10 I would rate this doctor just that.  Staff are rude and unprofessional. Do not waste your time here! Go find better services.

He overbooks his appointments -- I waited 90 minutes to be seen because ""his help was on vacation"".  I am letting my GP know never to send patients to him again.",Male
"Ok well first of  all i dont recommend any one to go here, for one you don't even see him more than two times.

Every single time I had an appointment I would have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes (sometimes up to 1 hour) before I would see him.  When I met with him, I felt like a number to him - his bedside manner is lacking and he always seemed a bit dismissive.  The staff is boarding on mean and doesn't have much regard for patients.",Male
Worst experience I've had a Dr ever! After waiting 2 months to been seen for 7 herniated disks and spinal stenosis.

I explained the one I have been taking for all the pain and I got lectured.,Female
Saw dr. Vachon in marinette wi.I was there because I had a lump on my neck. I've had lymphoma before.

I do not recommend anyone to see her.,Female
I am a patient advocate for a friend who was in MGH in September 2016. While there she was under the care of Dr. Vachon.  There were numerous problems related to this doctor including factual errors and inaccuracies in her medical reports; an aggressive approach pressuring my friend to go into a nursing home (which she clearly stated she did not want); threatening to get a court appointed guardian the next time my friend has to go to the hospital (knowing she has a PoA).  Avoid this doctor.,Female
Did not listen to me at all. Treated me like a junkie because i found ativan very well helped me not jump out of  windows{anxiety attacks} acter ER prescribed it.

Then he started cutting my toenails &amp; explained what he was doing and why. I again tried to talk to him about my hurt foot and he shoosed me. I got quiet for the next 5 toe trimmings but I really needed to talk to a foot doctor so I brought up my injured foot again.  This time, he said I just would not shut up and shook his head at me.",Male
"He misdiagnosed my foot  problem several times. And when I called to make another appointment the office had a new policy that required patients come in and update their patient information BEFORE they could make an appointment. 
I explained it's a 40 minute drive each way, and I asked if I could fill in the paperwork when I came in for an appointment with the Doctor. They insisted I couldn't make an appointment without first updating my info...and that ended that. Ridiculous. Never been back!!",Male

We asked Dr. Vachris if he'd be willing to stick with us until we found out what was wrong. He said he was up for the challenge and I went to the next appointment with my husband hopeful.

"Dr V came highly recommended from a personal friend. He and his staff were everything I was told they would be. He is professional, friendly, has a sense of humor. His assistant Dan was very knowledgeable and efficient. I saw Dr. V before and after surgery while in the hospital. When this knee heals completely he will definitely do the other one.",Male
"Great experience. I had frozen shoulder. He was able to diagnose it, give me cortisone shots to lower the inflammation and then send me to an excellent Physical Therapist and I am better in 2 months! I have a neighbor who recommended him who also raved about his shoulder surgery.",Male
Great surgeon.......he was the surgeon who replaced both of my knees......do what he says to recover properly.....Great staff......he stays booked.....because he is so good.....don't hesitate to make appt......it will just delay of your surgery,Male

"My file was sent to Dr. Vacik.   An appointment was scheduled in 4 weeks &amp; cancelling by his office.  A new appointment was scheduled &amp; cancelled.   A 3rd appointment was scheduled.  I went to his office, signed in, waited 15 minutes, went to the window &amp; was  told he was out of the office.   I was told that he was not going to see me as a patient.  I had tried for 3 months for him to see me.   If he had decided not to take me as a patient, his staff should have told me at the first cancellation",Male
"2004 was my first visit with Dr Vacirca and I will never regret my treatment,yes breast cancer and yes I am still here enjoying my life with triplet granddaughters.Thanks to Jeffrey caring,and so knowledgeable of all forms of cancer,Idid chemo ,radiation and five years oral medication.I trust this man with my life and remember him in my prayers everyday.My husband has just been diagnosed with lung cancer and yes he is  being treated by Dr Vacirca .I totally trust whatever treatment is best.",Male
"Dr. Vacirca makes you seem like he's your best friend, he'd do anything for you... Unfortunately, if an emergency situation arises, he will not be there. His associates are afraid to contact him. Please, find another doctor. I've now been a widow for 11 months - Dr. Vacirca told us this was an ""easy"" cancer - It's not 1970 anymore. We had no doubts that my husband would be fine.... He dropped the ball and my husband paid with his life...",Male

He spent too many of my appts on his cell phone. I would say this is the last time I am coming in and he would sit down and listen. Just not consistently. I like his mannerisms when he listens. He explains issues well when he takes the time. My very first appt was in the hospital after being admitted thru emergency and he never showed up. Billed my insurance and then yelled at me when I called for a follow up saying he wasn't accepting new patients. Huh.,Male
"VERY ROOD DOCTOR. {DOES NOT READ PATIENTS PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY BEFORE COMING INTO THE ROOM} POOR BEDSIDE MANNERS IN HOSPITAL SETTING COMES FEW DAYS AFTER CONSULT IS PUT IN AND RECOMMENDS D/C FOR YOU TO FOLLOW UP OUT PT/WITH YOUR DR SEEMS UNAWARE OF MRSA,CELLULITUS,CDIFF,LEAVING YOU VERY SICK I RECOMMEND YOU ASK FOR ANOTHER CONSULT AT THE HOSPITAL ",Female
"Dr. Vaclav literally saved my life , she was the only Dr. who found out my diagnoses , after having several Specialists who could not for the life of me figure it what I had . I had a very deadly infection.",Female
I am a long time patient of Dr Vaclav.  He is kind and very caring.  He listens with his attention totally on you. Sometimes runs late on appointment times because he listens.  I'm happy to wait as I know he will also give me whatever time is needed.,Male
"Dr. Vaclav is one of the most compassionate, caring Drs. around, whatever is going on with you, he will figure it out &amp; want to help you, he's a true old fashioned(but hip on all new technology &amp; meds, vitamins),He is in the business to help people feel better &amp; it shows in his care for his patients!!",Male
Great and always takes the time to listen and answer all questions! ,Male
Dr. Vaclavik made me feel so at ease when I was going through a difficult situation.   He guided me on options.   When I chose surgery he was very reassuring on the day of surgery for me and he talked to my husband afterwards.   I very much appreciate his ability to listen and explain.    I'm proud to say he is my Doctor.,Male
"First of all, I LOVE the Virginia's Women Center at St. Mary's hospital.
Secondly, Dr. Vaclavik is amazing. Courteous, knowledgeable, quick and funny--he walked me through my decision to get a Mirena IUD, and made the procedure as fast and painless and possible. ",Male
Really helped me out. Thanks for looking out,Male
Nicest Doc I have ever met! Highly recommend him! ,Male
"Dr. Vaclavik is an excellent clinician &amp; his staff is kind and caring.
I had to have a minor procedure done &amp; was extremely apprehensive.
Dr. Vaclavik went above &amp; beyond to make sure I was comfortable &amp; kept me informed during the entire process.",Male
Hands down 5 stars!!! He is the absolute best doctor I have ever had and if you are looking for that then do not look any further . He is simply amazing and top notch.  He takes his time at each appointment and answers any question(s). He is so compassionate and knowledgeable. I wish I could give him more stars !!!,Male

"Dr. V is amazing. Patient, relaxed, caring and knowledgeable. He is practical but kind. He was compassionate during my high risk pregnancy and further complications. He alongside Dr. Rogers saved my life. My family is grateful. ",Male
"Meeting Dr. Vaclaviik yesterday was a perfect experience, as I have been looking for the right doctor for years.  He is friendly and caring while being very professional , addressing all of your questions and concerns thoroughly. With most doctors you leave your appointment and still feel you needed to know more about something. Dr. Vaclaviik makes sure you are 100% informed and at ease with a definite game plan for your issues. I have finally found the right OB/GYN! I highly recommend Dr. Va",Male
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. As a doctors office they should be adhering to the mask mandate set by the Governor AND more importantly do no harm. They do not require patients to wear masks. Patient came in without a mask my husband and I were looking at each other like what the heck went to the front desk and they said we don’t require masks! So my husband and I waited in the hallway, lesson learned I should’ve left!

The “doctor” who looked at my broken toe had his mask hanging off his nose then his chin and was 2 feet from my face!! Luckily I had two masks in my bag so I double masked before he came in. After all that he said I’ll see you in two weeks. Ya didn’t happen. But I did Receive a bill for an x-ray that I never had there! I had the x-ray at the emergency room two days before. And then they also charged $46.38 to put a Band-Aid to keep one toe to the other. If you care about your well being and not being Charged for things that you didn’t have done. Stay clear.",Male
"My visit with Dr. Vaclaw was excellent.  I am recovering from a back surgery and I found him to be understanding and very accommodating.  Dr. Vaclaw was very personable, informative and answered any concerns I had clearly and in great detail.  I saw Dr. Vaclaw at the Woodlands facility and found the offices there to be very pleasing, comfortable and well set up for social distancing. Overall my visit was an really good experience and based on that I would recommend that anyone needing good podiatry services give him a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",Male
When he preformed plantar release surgery on my foot he caused severe nerve damage. I have been dealing with burning numbness pain for 4 years sense surgery. I have had neurologist and reconstructive foot surgeons. tell me that the damage is permanent.,Male

Reginald W. Curry  Humble,Tx.  2-11-2019",Male
"I had a serious issue that could have resulted in the loss of my foot.  The responsiveness and care that I received from Drs Conley, Toole and Vaclaw contributed greatly to my ability to walk again.  I know the care of the patient is what is important to them.  I'm forever grateful!",Male
I saw Dr. Toole in Huntsville for my foot problem. He was extremely through. He taught me about everything needed to make my feet better. Dr. Toole is very down to earth but professional. Huntsville will appreciate having this doctor .,Male
I highly recommend Dr. Vaclaw! He truly cares and listens to all of your concerns. He is very thorough and really goes the extra mile to find out the cause of your pain. He is extremely knowledgeable and very professional! I had seen a couple doctors before him that didn't really take the time to listen to my concerns and I wasn't getting the answers I felt I needed. A friend referred Dr. Vaclaw to me and I finally got the answers I was looking for and it was a tremendous relief!!! ,Male
"I’ve had ingrown toenails 45 years, 3 prior excision &amp; avulsions, creams,soaks, etc for over 20Yrs. A surgery in 7-2017, had minor complications when it reoccurred, by grace I ended up at Dr. Vaclaw as new patient, his staff was courteous, Dr. Vaclaw used more conservative treatment combined with topical custom compound he prescribed &amp; treatment he solved problem &amp; pain &amp; cured its cause. Wish id found him years ago, so grateful for his genuine interest, concern, commitment and excellent care.",Male
Never again.  The visit was a waste of time and money.  ,Male
"I appreciated Dr. Vaclaw's step-wise approach to treating my plantar fasciitis. We started with stretching and an anti-inflammatory, first, which provided a huge jump toward total recovery. Ended up with a steroid shot to finish getting to total recovery. No surgery needed - YEAH! It took a few weeks but I'm able run and ride my bike again.",Male
Dr. Vaclaw helped my son with an ingrown toenail. Thank you Dr. Vaclaw!,Male
Great doc took great care of my daughter. ,Male
"I have so many years of subpar client relations to share but I'll just detail my latest visit.  My husband went to this clinic for ongoing back pain.  Dr. did not do any xrays- didn't even look at his back.  Told him it would be pain pills or surgery. That seems like a radical spectrum of treatment without even examining the area in question.   Prescribed him 60 days of pain medication. Went to get it filled and they are only able to  fill 7 days worth of pain medication due to current regulation.  I contacted the nurse to have this issued resolved- with a recurring prescription - number of refills.  After two days- they finally returned my call and they have advised that for he will have to come into the clinic EVERY week (leaving work each time) to get a new prescription.  Of course, there will be a copay and recurring charge each week in addition to the cost of losing work each week.  I expect the doctor know the limitations of his own prescriptions. This is a racket to get more $$",Male
Dr. Vaclaw is the best!! Very caring and always is there to meet my needs,Male
Dr. Vaclaw truly cares about his patients. He goes above and beyond for my family- we are so thankful to have found a doctor we trust! ,Male
He spent about 1-5 minutes with me about my suicide attempt that landed me in  the geriatric psych ward (I was in my early 30s.) because I'd O.D.ed so bad that I was unable to walk. He precribed a medication that I'd already taken (that has a history of making me suicidal) without any time for questions or concerns that I'd already tried that med. Terrible. I went to the hospital 3 more times that year after that.,Male
"Dr Vad has a very good reputation and I was pleased with his care 15 years ago when I had neck pain.  Three months ago I went to him for severe back pain.  The appointment was 10 minutes max.  He examined me and said it could be my back or my hip.  He offered any NSAID medication and vitamins.

 I had to pay out of pocket because he doesn't accept Medicare.  I ended up calling another doctor for help. I was in so much pain I needed painkillers for two weeks.   Another doctor ordered an MRI and I have a herniated lumbar disc.  I may need surgery.  Dr. Vad missed the severity of my problem because he was too busy.",Male
"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Vad and his expertise.  For many years I have been tossed around to orthopedic doctors, chiropractors, physical therapists, etc.  Dr. Vad is the only physician who took a holistic approach to my recovery.  He worked with me closely over a long-term plan rather than just a quick fix, which would never work.  From his exercises, to diet recommendations, and his miracle injections that have literally changed my life.  I cannot recommend him to anyone more highly.",Male
Great diagnostician. Caring compassionate bedside manner.  He diagnosed my chronic hamstring strain as nerve irritation from disc in 2 minutes and got rid of pain- i had suffered for 2 years prior,Male
"I have spent many years of my life as a semi-professional athlete.  At my advanced age it's all catching up to me!  Dr. Vad has helped me for over 15 years on my back, knees, elbows, shoulders, etc.  I cannot recommend him highly enough.  He's not only the best, but the most kind with the greatest sense of compassion.  I don't know what I'd do without him.",Male
"Dr. Vad is a stellar physician, professional, and human being.  No doctor has given me better care than he.  From my very first appointment Dr. Vad took the time to listen to me, he didn't rush anything, and he developed a plan to help me with my back and hip pain.  He would call to check on my progress, he always followed up, and he is truly a caring doctor.  After many years of chronic pain, I finally feel like I have gotten my life back because of him.",Male
"5 stars aren't enough. Dr. Vad is spectacular. Smart, efficient, insightful, practical, and kind.  Explains everything. Encourages physical activity.",Male
"I had been to a total of six different types of doctors for recurring pain in my ankles and the surgeon suggested surgery.  I tried Dr. Vad as a last resort since I didn't want surgery.  Dr. Vad said surgery is a last resort and so I tried his suggestions.  Kept me out of surgery and with some injections I'm running again, something I never thought would happen.  At 68 years old, he's made me feel young again!  Thank you Dr. Vad!",Male
"I don't know what I would do without Dr. Vad.  I work in Stowe Vermont as a ski instructor in the winter and trail guide in the summers.  I suffered injuries years ago that have come back as crippling pain in my ankle, knee, and both hips.  I had tried every type of doctor and therapy, chiropractic, massage, and orthopedic intervention.  My friend told me to travel to New York and see Dr Vad.  He truly saved me!  He is a concerned healer and I thank him for giving me my strength and hope back.",Male
Best doctor for pain Mgt in NYC.  Cutting edge treatment and stays ahead of the curve. I highly recommend him to anyone who suffers from arthritis of the hip and knees.  The results are unbelievable.  Outstanding .,Male
"Dr. Vad is one of the best doctors I have ever had. He genuinely cares about getting to the root of the problem and influencing your future to make sure you stay healed. In my case it was a snowboarding accident that threw my back completely out of whack and multiple visits to other doctors that had done nothing but temporarily numbed the pain. Dr. Vad's demeanor made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was in good hands. He was able to reduce the inflammation, reduce the pain and get ",Male
"I have been suffering from debilitating arthritis for many years.  I was lucky enough to be referred to Dr. Vad and meet this extraordinary physician.  Dr. Vad gave me several injections and it changed my ability to feel alive--again.   He treated me holistically, by making diet suggestions, he gave me his anti-inflammatory supplements at no cost, and my pain has been reduced dramatically, I can never thank him enough.  All of his advice was straight-forward, and easy to follow, a true healer.",Male
"I visited multiple other Doctors and Surgeons only to be told they cannot/will not repair the 3 torn discs in my lower back only to relieve severe pain. Everyone said the medical technology is not where it needs to be to help me. After examining me and reviewing all of my history Dr. Vad told me he could help. It's been several years now and I'm back to work, back to doing things with my family and even traveling. All thanks to Dr. Vad. Listen to him! Do what he says, he can help you.",Male
"I've wondered why my previous negative review of Dr. Vad disappeared. Apparently doctors can remove negative reviews on Vitals and Healthgrades. My visit with Dr. Vad four years ago was terrible. He saw me for 5-7 minutes, didn't look at my MRI or X-rays, sold his products (book, vitamins, cream, etc.), and worst of all, gave me a diagnosis that ended up being inaccurate. I am stubbornly reposting because it is wrong that such an insincere doctor is being presented as a good one.",Male
"I saw Dr. Vad after I had back surgery and I was told by my surgeon I had “scar tissue” and had to learn to live with the pain.  Dr. Vad gave me a long-term plan of exercises and stretches, and referred me to a Pilates instructor.  After the first two weeks I could feel a dramatic improvement, and by one month the pain was totally gone.  I have stuck to his plan and the difference is like night and day.  Dr. Vad gave me an alternative that most doctors would never suggest. ",Male
Wonderful experience! Easy to speak with.  Nice way about him!  Highly recommend.,Male
"I was diagnosed with bone spurs that were preventing me from walking normally.  Dr. Vad suggested an alternative treatment to surgery, of injections near my ankle and heel.  I cannot believe I am not only walking well again, I am actually able to run again.  I never thought I would have this relief.  Dr. Vad has the best bedside manner and is compassionate to people's suffering.  He is a great listener and I appreciate all he has done for me.  I feel alive again!",Male
"I had a herniated disc and years of back pain.  I saw four other doctors who all said to take more pills which just destroyed my stomach, and I never felt any better.  When Dr. Vad gave me an epidural injection I had immediate relief for the first time! Because I am on my feet for many hours a day as a teacher the soreness and pain felt constant and left me out of work for many days. I cannot recommend Dr. Vad more highly if anyone has chronic pain with cures that have failed elsewhere.",Male
"Dr. Vad is a miracle worker to say the least. Without going in length, I've suffered uncomfortable knee pain for longer than I can remember.  After visiting Dr. Vad several times, while I was in NYC for business, I am able to walk at ease again.  I cannot thank him enough and the friend who recommended Dr. Vad.  ",Male
"As my condition worsens 7 months after a botched lumbar epidural injection performed by Dr. Vad, I am compelled to share my story so no one else suffers as I am.  Dr. Vad is an arrogant and incompetent physician, in my opinion.  He performed a rushed transforaminal epidural injection without contrast dye under ""high pressure"" (in his own words) and damaged my L4 nerve causing excrutiating pain and numbness in my right leg.  I am told I now have irreversible nerve damage.  Dr. Vad is awful.",Male
"I have had years of stiffness and pain with both my shoulder and my knees.  Every surgeon and physician always said it was just ""part of getting older.""  That all changed with Dr. Vad.  He gave me steps to improve my flexibility, that included simple changes in diet, supplements, and a new routine of progressive exercises.  I have been PAIN FREE for the last YEAR and it's been incredible.  Thank you Dr. Vad for giving me my freedom back.",Male
"Dr. Vadada did not follow up with me. I had to hound her for over a month each time to get a return call. After near two years of being shuttled back and forth and finally complaining, she dismissed me, refused to help me, told me to go out of network if I didn't like it and refused to provide a referral. I think she is a very cold and unpleasant person. It is terrible to not be able to see and have a doctor care so little about you.",Female
"Dr Vadada performed a cornea transplant on me after I had a complication from cataract surgery from another surgeon. I am so grateful for my restored vision thanks to Dr. Vadada. Words cannot express my gratitude, I think of her more often than she knows.",Female
"Well, I never ended up seeing Dr. Vadada. I sat in the waiting room for over an hour, before finally being called in by the PA to be told there were still 4 people in front of me. I had made this appointment a couple months in advance, and used my lunch break to make it work. When I asked if it's common for the wait time to be an hour or more the answer I was given was ""Yea, pretty common"". What?? Why are they making so many appointments then? At no time was I advised by anyone in the office of the wait time. If you have hours to sit around, then this is the doctor's office for you.",Female
Takes his time with the patient. Felt very comfortable with his expertise,Male
Very caring informative and professional ,Male
"Very professional, great bedside manner, listens and explains so I totally understand.
After my accident he has treated me  for my neck and back pain to help me and is excellent. No pain pills by treating with injection and or ablation??!
Wish I found him sooner!
Recommended him to people I’ve met or know that take pain pills when it very likely can be avoided!!",Male
Saw Dr. Vadada-explained my situation and test results completely so I understood it. Had recommended treatment to alleviate pain and condition. Very happy patient I am! Am hopeful to feel better and can start regimen he prescribed. Thank you!!!,Male
"Dr. Vadada is most personable and approaches patient interaction in a very thorough and non-hurried manner, making for ease of interaction. ",Male
"My injury was in my lower spine.  I was very afraid to try any procedure to help me with the pain for fear of something worse happening.  Dr. Vadada took the time and used his professionalism to explain to me what was going on in my spine and what he wanted to do to help ease the pain.  Though I was still fearful, I agreed and went through with the procedure. Even his staff was very professional.  My ending result was the ability to get back into my life activities. Great Doctor!!",Male
"Fantastic Doc. Very knowledgeable and direct. Explains conditions and treatments very nicely , Extremely empathetic to my condition without being superficial. I trust my life on him ",Male
"Dr. Laisa Vadakara is an excellent doctor. She is very caring, thorough and takes time to help you. She explains things and answers questions. I can get medical advice whenever I need which is the most important thing for a patient from a  pcp. I am absolutely satisfied with her.
I highly recommend visiting Dr. Laisa Vadakara .",Female
"After hearing so many great things about Dr. Vadakara,I decided to go to her as my primary physician.  It's been almost a year, and I cannot say enough good things about her. I've seen her several times.  She spends a lot of time with you, is kind, caring and VERY thorough. Her office staff is the nicest and also very helpful and accommodating. Thank you Dr. V. For everything you've done for me!!  I plan to be your patient for a long, long time??",Female
I have been seeing Dr Laisa Vadakara for a couple years now and I am absolutely satisfied with her  medical care....She is thorough and explains things in a way I understand. She does not leave any stones unturned....She usually has a resident in with her to help her and learn from her... The Dr and her staff are amazing and very helpful... and I have needed a lot of help this last year. Wish I could pay them back for all they do for me !!,Female
He is very carrier and so kind and he takes time to really make you no he is a very very good Dr .God bless him and his family ????????????,Male
"Dr V is very thorough, he changed my medication and I feel a lot better.  

Staff is great best part of my visit",Male
Great Doctor,Male
"Dr. V is great!!!  I have been going to him for many years.  This is one Dr. visit that I never dread or am anxious about.  He is always on time and easy to talk to.  He answers any questions I have.  Usually within a day I am able to pull my results down from the portal.  This Diabetic and Glandular clinic is huge and always packed.  This is one of the most efficiently run offices that I have ever seen.  Everyone is friendly, helpful, professional and informative.  Easy to make or change appointments.  Dr. V and his PA Dr. Tuscani are just all around good people.",Male
"I have been seeing Dr V for about 15 years. He encouraged me to have my parathyroids removed due to my having an elevated calcium level. It took a few years for that procedure to come about because I had some cardiac issues that came up, but my having that surgery ultimately saved my like because during the course of that surgery, they discovered that I had cancer of the thyroid and removed it the following month. I am doing great now and Dr V continues to monitor my thyroid levels and makes sure that I continue on this healthy pathway.",Male
"Wonderful, understanding Doctor.  Easy to talk to and explains in terms one can understand.",Male
The worst doctor ever. Put me on a drug that has damaged my kidneys and then blew it away as if no big deal.,Male
I have had the best experience with the whole staff at the DGD Clinic. I am from out of town and before I came here I had been put on insulin and medication without being given any other options. My doctor had told me there was no other option and that I would eventually end up on insulin at some point... I was only 29. I remember the first time I ever met Dr. V he removed me and began me on pills and let me tell you I went from a 13 to a 6. Dr. v and Dr. Huckaby are my angels!!,Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. V for over ten years. I can truly say that he is the best doctor I have ever seen. I am 72 years old and he always looks me in the eye and asks, ""how are you feeling? Any stress, problems, or changes in your life?"". And he actually listens. He has notes from our last meeting but he remembers little things like helping my mother in law move or flying to San Diego last time. He warns me when I go off my diet or not exercise and he praises me when I did well. Fantastic.",Male
"Dr. V has been my Dr. for the last 5 years. I absolutely love his down to earth, easy to talk to and he tells me like it is demeanor . He is very professional and very helpful.",Male
"Everything about this doctor was completely unethical and disgraceful.  I'd never been disrespected by ANY practitioner the way he disrespected me.  Completely unprofessional, terrible bedside manner and extremely rude.  This is a used-car salesman type of doctor - attempted to treat me for conditions for which I am already under care for (for which was not his specialty to begin with), placing very low priority to the critical condition for which I was there for.  Utterly disgusted.",Male
"I really liked Dr V (as he is called), he is a very thorough Dr. He explained exactly what was going with my thyroid &amp; what we were going to do. I was very impressed.",Male
"He's knowledgeable, but his bedside manner is horrible. Half the time, he ignores questions and fires off a short answer and moves on to something else. He actually told me I had to get my thyroid removed, without consulting with me about it at all. It took several visits for him to explain fully why he recommended that.. It just seems like he wants to get rid of you as quickly as possible.",Male
"I would recommend him because he explains my condition to where I understand it, not just in doctor terms.",Male
"Dr. V delivered my daughter 3.5 years ago with no complications. I am now pregnant with my second and returned to her for care. When I had a negative screening result she called me to tell me and she personally got on the phone everytime I called with questions. Everything worked out well, but I appreciate knowing she was easily accessible in what could have been a scary situation. I never have problems with communication with her or her staff, highly recommend.",Female
"Doctor V was great but getting in contact with someone about the test results is a nightmare.  Nobody will answer my calls.  I leave messages and not hear back.  I received one call weeks after my test and have not heard from them again.  If you want someone to communicate test results, go some where else.",Female
Dr. V has been the best OB/GYN doctor ever and I am 48 yo. She explained what was going on with my body and suggested treatments. She did end up performing robotic lap hysterectomy and it came out perfect with no issues. I HIGHLY recommend her.,Female
I feel she truly cares for your well-being. She listens and answers questions thoroughly. I feel very calm around her during check-ups or procedure.,Female
I do not like going to the Dr. but Dr. V makes the visits relaxed and she takes the time to listen to what is going on and explains any actions or procedures clearly.  She is interested in the whole health of her patients and she is very caring.,Female
"Great customer service,nice people....",Female
She is very kind and informative. She always takes the time to make sure I don’t have any questions or concerns.,Female
Great doctor! ,Male
First problem was insurance related. I have private insurance and needed to make a plan to pay the co pay and was treated as if I was asking for free service. I should have changed doctors then. Next its always scheduling problem I work forty hours a week and I take off for appointments I walk in at 250 for a 245 appointment and they refuse to see me and make me reschedule so another day off from work. That's tacky and uncaring I will change doctors now.,Female
"Dr. Vadala is an amazing surgeon. She performed a carpal tunnel release on my right hand. I have had no numbness in the hand since surgery. Also, there is no scar. In addition, she is very personable and answers all questions. She will be performing the same surgery on my left hand in two weeks.",Female

"Dr. Vadala has seen my children since my daughter was born (my son an infant}.  We had one more appointment so my daughter could get ready for college.  Unfortunately, we could not make it.  Dr. V himself is a great physician but his office staff is not so great.  I spent 1.5 hours last year after a custody modification paving the way for a smooth transition and now the staff refuses to recognize this.

He has taken care of our children for almost 23 years. We love him. Our “kids” still choose to see him and he’ll have to kick us out someday I guess.,Male
"I have  been seeing Dr. Vadala with my children for the last 14 years he never ceases to amaze me and I love his honesty, his promptness and his ability to make me feel comfortable with the decisions that need to be made.",Male
"Dr. Richard Vadala does not follow through with his plan of care for your sick child!
He is narcissistic in the sense  that he doesn't consider what the child and child's family is going through. It's all a game for him. I am very disappointed in Vadala.",Male
"My daughter has been going to Dr. Vadala since she was 2 months old and is now 13 years old.  He was Avery's father's doctor when he was a child.  We love Dr. Vadala, he is so kind to his patients. He is awesome!",Male
I love my kids' doctor! He has taken wonderful care of them for 15 years - thorough and dedicated.,Male
Very kind and takes and professional.,Male
"Do not see Dr Maitrayee Vadali-run in the other direction! She lacks communication skills, creates unnecessary panic, overreacts and prescibes unnecessary expensive medicines and, last but not least, she didn't read my cardiac cath results prior to my visit and failed to catch a serious dictation error, sending me once again for more tests, medicines-even saying that I should get my affairs in order!! Turned out to be s simple dictation error that I solved myself. Also not aware of mech failure!",Female
she is good at her service and staff also very friendly ,Female
"Sweetest Doctor Ever. She has tons of patience listening to the condition of the kid and she never rushes. 
Her Video calling facility is great, catering to the distant treatment amongst COVID-situation. My kids LOVE her.",Female
"She is the most amazing Pediatrician I've ever seen and genuinely cares for the patients. She and her family even attended my daughter's first birthday party, that's how much she cares!! The staff in the Old Bridge office is amazing as well, especially Jane. ",Female
Best doctor ever.,Female
"Dr Vadali and Dr Osman are very good,but their staff in Old Bridge is very mean and ridiculous. If you are 10 mins late even if you have a small baby, they will make you wait forever.",Female
Dr Vadali treats kids in very cordial way. She is very accommodating for urgent appointments based on the condition; and this is very important.,Female
"No issue with doctor, but some staff members are very careless. They mess up the prescription. So I had to spend whole today between doc staff and insurance. I was at the point take child to urgent care and have doc pay the bill.",Female
"Excellent Care.   
Dr. Vadalia, Dr. Mills and the medical staff in the GPU at the Eliot Hospital are the most caring group of professionals I’ve met in a very long time. Dementia is a cruel disease which can be handled in a loving and dignified manner and this group is exemplary. I can’t thank them enough for their knowledge and support during one of the most difficult times in my family’s life. Dr. Mills and Dr. Kornfeld were our angels and provided heartfelt guidance and support during our mom’s hospitalization and, ultimately, her passing. Our family will never forget the kindness shown by all. Thank you.",Male
A real flake worst person that draws his conclusions without investigation,Male

Dr.  V.  is my elderly mother's  doctor.  He is so caring and a legitimately thorough and excellent caregiver. He takes so much time with her  We love him.  I wouldn't want any other doctor for her.  He is all about quality of life. ,Male
Dr. Waack is the best. He saved my sons life by recognizing a serious illness and acting quickly.  He cares more than most physicians I have seen.  I will always be grateful,Male
"He is a disgrace to finley hospital,  rude and mocks patients. As a 29 year old healthy female  b/p was 148/104 laughed and said it wasnt bad. Did not take any symptoms of A TIA seriously laughed and said it was anxiety. Could hear him in hall way actually laughing about me. One other encounter with him he saw me for 3 minutes said lets make this easy and through me a script for vicodin and muscle relaxer..I was there for uti symptoms. Always in a rush and doesnt care about his patients.",Male
I was mortified by the treatment I received by Dr. Berry Waack. He is a horrible Doctor that walked in the room yelling and left the room with my 11 year old daughter and I in tears. My daughter was  suffering from  terrible headache. He said it was normal and the lumps and swelling on the neck and side of he face were ok also. Well I will run out of characters if I tell the whole story so here it is NOT RECOMMENDED! TERRIBLE! It ended up that she had Lyme's Disease.  Qwack is Waack!! Disgusting,Male
Dr. Waack doesn't care about patients. He is the worst doctor I have ever been to. He treats patients as a number and not as people. He is in a hurry to see you and get out of the room. I was overcharged for 10-15 minutes for his visit. I would never go back to Finely as they don't care about patients and are very rude beyond what I'd expect from so called professionals.  I was hudon't like being hung up by the staff after asking questions. Charge about $26 a minute in ER.,Male

Great guy and excellent Dr. I’ve been seeing Dr Waalkes for a number of years now. He is the best. ,Male
"Dr.Waalkes has been my doctor for 15 years I couldn't imagine If I had to change.He has literally saved my life. A great listener, very compassionate and takes the time to understand your problem. Very easy to talk to and takes  the time to make you feel comfortable. Being ex-military with a lot of issues Dr. Waalkes has gone above and beyond to help me. There are no words except I cant thank you enough for all you have done for me over the years.",Male
Dr Phil is very thorough taking the time to listen and provide diagnosis in simple and easy to understand examples and terms.   I’ve been a patient of Dr Phil for many years and trust his judgement and diagnosis.  I highly recommend Dr Waalkes and his services!,Male
"Just got off the phone with scheduling.  He is accepting new patients but, his first available new patient appointment is one year out.  Is this normal now.",Male
"I have been seeing Dr. Waalkes for many years, primarily for annual physicals. Never have I doubted his ability to render the best care possible. His diagnosis are always accurate and his treatment plans are geared toward the patient, not just a ""one size fits all"" approach. 

Dr. Waalkes is always candid with my health care. I trust his advice. If I had to find another PCP tomorrow, I doubt I would find one that I trust as much as I do this doctor.",Male
"My daughter broke her femur 7 years ago (she was only 6 at the time). Dr. Waanders was great! He explained the entire surgery to me before he took her in, and then spent 20 minutes AFTER the surgery answering all my questions. He was very thorough with all of our follow-up appointments. I highly recommend him.",Male
"Dr. Waara has been my physician for over 10 years and I thought she was a very good doctor.  However here is my recent experience:  
--It took more than 3 months to get an appointment for a yearly physical
-- Received a letter from her requesting an extra out of pocket $100 fee for the privilege of being a patient
--When I arrived for the appointment, was informed that she is no longer accepting my BCBS insurance (decision was made 2 days prior)
Seems like money not patients is the priority.",Female
Excellent physician very knowledgeable and excels in his field. ,Male
"Interested, emphatic, and knowledgable.  Great doctor and great guy to interact with.  Very patient and superlative listener.  Top notch.",Male
"Was disappointed in my experience with Dr. Waarvick. Had high expectations going in based off reading some me good reviews. Although face to face he is a good listener, outside of the office visit he is extremely inaccessible. Instead of responding directly to patients like other MD's, he instead seems to dodge his patients by outsourcing all communication to a team of nurses who respond with smug, arrogant copy paste replies along with false accusations of his patients. Not an ethical practice.",Male
"Dr. Waarvick has always had a knack for addressing medical concerns — even some challenging ones — without making them seem 'scary' or insurmountable. He takes the requisite time to connect on a personal level and really listen to what you have to say about your own knowledge of your conditions, yet it is clear that he backs up his recommendations and guidance with careful research, knowledge, and reading. I would recommend Kim Waarvick wholeheartedly as a fantastic family doctor!",Male
Everything doctors should be practicing everything medicine should be. Quickly put him in charge of my entire family's care. ,Male
"Phenomenal doctor. Caring and willing to go above and beyond to help. I've never, in my history of medical care, had a more empathetic physician so willing to work with me on health issues. I could not recommend him enough. 

Dr. Waarvick is clearly very knowledgeable and recommended treatment options no other physician had, and these options worked incredibly well.",Male
"Waas was able to explain what’s happening but his support staff is unable to coordinate with hospitals, insurance and testing facilities. Staff does not listen to patients needs, makes decisions on patients behalf without consultation. Delays in communication or just no communication. Poor performance ",Male
"I attended Dr. Waas for the first time today with fear and apprehension. On meeting him all worries disappeared.  I found
him to be very caring, understanding and aware of my anxiety.
He explained plainly and clearly all aspects of my condition.
He answered all my questions and more. I thought that Dr. Waas
was just great.",Male
"Dr.  Waas is fine but beware that if you're admitted to the hospital, his office has refused to work with most basic insurance companies like BCBS PPO and as a hospital admittee you have no choice as to the doctor assigned to you so you don't know he doesn't take your insurance.  They then send  you  to a collections agency despite having called them and let them know that you're appealing to insurance for payment along with 2 more lung surgeries.  Absolutely not recommend for this reason.",Male
"She seemed unprepared for my visit (E.g.:  Had not read my file, seemed to not know anything about my health issues, or where we were in our process of obtaining a diagnosis. She had not even read the results from the new list of labs that she ordered).  Also, I had a very difficult time understanding her English due to her accent, and for me, communication is the #1 requirement of my physician.  I had to repeatedly ask her to repeat herself.  Also, seemed plugged into the computer, with her back towards me, for most of my visit  (even though she had a Scribe present, who was documenting everything for her).  Left there feeling so confused about exactly what is driving my health problems, because she seemed ""scattered, all over the board"", but since she referred me to other specialists, I am hoping to have this cleared up when I see them.  I will not go back to Dr. Waas.",Female
Dr Waas was wonderful! I really liked her and found UW medicine a great place to have an appointment. ,Female
Terrible doctor.  Poor communicator.  Unprepared.  Unprofessional.,Female
"I am a patient of Dr. W since 2002. I highly recommend this doctor for his depth of knowledge, sound clinical judgement, accuracy in diagnosis, even for rare conditions, adopting correct treatment plan, educating patient appropriately, discussing prognosis,  empathy, &amp; compassion for patients,  and monitoring the patient diligently. He obtains thorough medical history, orders required diagnostic work up. After moving out of PA, I could not find any other physician like him.",Male
This listing is broken.  I don't work here anymore and healthgrades doesn't allow me to edit my location to reflect my new hospital in a different state.,Male
"Saved my life and was the first to take me seriously. When she didn’t have the answers, she referred me to someone who did. ILY dr.waasdorp ??",Female
She is incredible!  She never dis appoints.  She treats us like family.  I trust her completely. ,Female
Such a sweet and Caring Physician,Female
little attention to the history of symptoms explained to her about previous conditions and treatment. ,Female
Have been a patient for many years.  She is responsible for saving my life.  She encouraged me to have a lump removed when ultra sound reading showed ok.  It turned out to be cancer and was not just in the lump spread outside margins.  That was 2009 and at this time no re-occurrence.  She listens and is extremely knowledgeable.  She takes the right steps no matter if it is a cold or heart problem.  Five stars aren't enough.,Female
"Dr. Wabeke diagnosed me with back spurs, directed me to a spine center.  While waiting for that appt. pain got very bad.  Called office to see if I could get pain med.  Told I had to see Dr.  Went and she said ""we don't give pain meds for arthritis"".  That was my question.- not a doctor, did not know.  Received call the next day and told not to come back.  Communication break down.  There was no communication - she fired me as a patient!  I don't have a clue why. ",Female
"NEVER! A cancer diagnosis was missed that changed a young woman's life forever. The staff is rude and condescending. The doctor refused to investigate when the patient explained (on multiple visits) ""something isn't right."" Had they taken the time to investigate early on they could have caught this before it became a football size tumor. The patient had to demand a referral to a specialist and even that was met with resistance. So disgusted with this office. ",Female
"I was with her for over a decade but when I switched to a HMO policy, she would not do the paper work even though she referred me to the other doctors. I ended up with thousands of dollars in bills and she lied and claimed she did the paperwork even though I had it in writing from the ins co that she didn't. After months of fighting over it, my stress was very high and I msg her that I did not feel safe and she turned off the mychart so I couldn't contact her. I will never recommend her.",Female
"My first (and maybe only-i believe in 'chances) took 3+ months to get seen. Was not treated as a physical but billed as such. Got hostile attitude from receptionist because she didn't give me paperwork she was trying to have me ""sign"" for. Doctor stopped caring when I told her preferences and said ""We aren't a pain facility."" Yet she specializes in ""osteoarthritis"" and ""arthritis"".",Female
"Dr. Wabeke is kind, friendly and easy to work with. She spends time answering questions and going over different treatment or medication options when I am concerned about one. ",Female
"She is kind,patient and generous with her time and talent.",Female
"Dr. Wabixh was amazing. She was very kind and took her time to explain everything to me, and even squeezed me in for a procedure asap. A",Female
I was never able to see the doctor. She canceled three appointments with me with no regard for the condition I was seeking treatment for or the fact I adjusted my work schedule to accommodate the appointments. I gave up and sought treatment with a different doctor.,Female
"Several cancellations....... I booked three appointments with Dr. Wabich and she canceled ALL three. It was an extreme inconvenience as I adjusted my work calendar to accommodate the appointments. Further, I spent at least 30 minutes on the phone with each booking. I gave up on her and sought out another doctor.",Female
"Dr. Wabich seemed to have a good knowledge of her field. She was very dismissive of me when I had input to give about my medical history. It was clear she had not spent time reading my chart to prepare for our consultation. She also began to give me medical advise about how other aspects of my medical care, which was contrary to my various specialists' decisions. Overall, she seems qualified in her field, but overstepped her boundaries and did not make me an active participant. ",Female
This guy is a horrible person. Staff is also pretty bad. Refills were a huge problem and now he charges outrageous fee. Save yourself and avoid this one.,Male
Great doctor! Very genuine personality- you can tell he really cares about his patients because he really takes the time to address their concerns no matter how long it takes. Would definitely recommend!,Male
"on of the most compassionate and knowledgeable doctors I have ever met.  He will not order something for you unless he believes you need it - a great advantage today when it comes to cost saving for me, his other patients and the health care system in general. ",Male
Visited the Dr called on a Saturday the office staff was accommodating Dr was patient and explained what was going on with me,Male
He is very kind and made me feel that my concern was understood. Both my husband and I have always requested him when we got to have Kaiser insurance again. He is down to earth and easy to talk to. He is a very good listener. I never felt rushed and I ask a lot of questions. ,Male
"I had lower back spinal fusion in 2013 after 5 years in pain. He took care of that. No more pain. 
He is amazing!",Male
"I am so fortunate to be a patient of Dr Wachhorst.  I had an acutely ruptured herniated lumbar disc.  Dr Wachhorst squeezed me in for a consultation, despite a full schedule.  His team at PAMF clinic as well as ECH OR were also very helpful; none of them made me feel as if i was putting them out.   I had urgent lumbar laminotomy with decompression of the nerve.    Two weeks postop, my leg and foot symptoms are already improved.  I am so grateful and relieved!",Male
"I would strongly suggest you find yourself another doctor.  Dr. Dennis Wachi is emotionless and I really feel he does not care about his patients.  He is like a robot when breaking bad news to his patients.  He has absolutely no sympathy at all.  Here is the kicker...when my mother had to go into hospice, he opted out of following her into hospice.  In other words, we now had to get a hospice physician for her because Dr. Wachi didn't want to be her physician anymore.  Gutless!",Male
"Dennis Wachi and his entire team are the best examples of how to have a professional and personal relationship between doctor and patient.   Dr. Wachi has a diagnostic intuitive/learned gift.  He is relentless and caring with any medical gripe, big or small.

He is the modern incantation of a Country doctor.  His phone message allows leaving a message, and a follow up appointment is prompt. His office folks know all the patients. 

He is funny, but takes patient care seriously.",Male
someone who you can trust,Male
Excellent!!,Male
Wonderful doctor. He takes the time to explain things and calm any fears that i may have.,Male
wonderful. he really listens and tries to help,Male
"Before I started seeing Dr. Wachira, I was on high doses of Prednisone and had multiple hospitalizations for my asthma.  Since I've been seeing Dr. Wachira, I've been off Prednisone and haven't had any hospitalizations! He changed my course of action with my meds and my asthma is now well controlled! I went from needing him monthly to 3 months, now every 6 months.  He is the absolute best and he truly saved my life!",Male
Always very professional and caring and very pleasant,Male
Good conversation with new orders.,Male
He seems quite friendly and eager to get me started on diagnosis and treatment.,Male
I Love ,Male
"Dr Wachira was as usual, very professional and courteous and on point with my issues.  He discussed my issues with and made sure I understood and was comfortable with the plan. His kind and pleasant approach is much appreciated. He is great example of a doctor with great bedside manner or the doctor is treats patients very respectfully.",Male
Dr. Wachira takes interest in me.,Male
The doctor explained everything to me in clear and positive manner.,Male
good,Male
Dr. Wachira always takes time to answer any question you may have to help you understand your disease.  Great doctor!,Male
Dr. Wachira impressed me from my first appointment.  He did not make assumptions based on my appearance or demeanor.  He listened to what was going on in my life to help explain my situation and treatment plan.  I would recommend him to anyone who wants a doctor that cares in the truest sense of the word.,Male
very nice experience  very thorough explanations,Male
"Dr. Wachira was the pulmonogist that came to see me in radiology dept at Baptist downtown after I had a bilateral mastectomy and had to have chest tube following puncture of my lung when surgeon attempted insertion of infusaport. He confirmed for me that indeed they were likely not going to be able to reposition chest tube and would need to pull it and reinsert one in another location. He was caring, compassionate and kind. I will never be able to thank him enough for the role he played during that time. Clarissa Jones",Male
"All of my concerns were addressed. As usual, Dr. Wachira put my fears to rest. We decided to revisit my medications in a month.  My only problem was that I could not see Dr. Wachira on my virtual visit for some reason.",Male
Fabulous doctor!,Male
Very disappointed in him and staff.   On 8/28 I saw him and was told he would put in a referral for me to my primary that day.   On 9/18 I called and staff told me nothing has been done yet but they would check with the doctor and have something submitted bu Friday.   My primary was advised and his staff too is getting the run around.  This is unacceptable treatment and lacks patient care.  I hate being lied to and deceived.,Male
"Dr Wachs is an excellent caring Doctor, something you don't find very often these days.  He takes his time to explain your condition and his plan for your care.  He's so intelligent and is so easy to talk to that we actually got all of our questions and concerns answered. He has always been very thorough and makes sure all tests necessary are done promptly.  With Dr Wachs we know without a doubt we have one of the best doctors. We highly recommend him if you want excellent care.
",Male
"My visit with Dr. Wachs was excellent. He is very attentive and forms relationships with his patients. His staff is also very friendly. He took the time to answer all of my questions, and was never rushed, or in a hurry to go to the next patient. He made me feel comfortable and at ease, and gave me great recommendations. I would highly recommend that you see him and I think you will feel exactly the same as I do. Thanks Doctor!",Male
Dr.Wachs is a great doctor. He was very informative and was able to answer all of my questions. I am a happy patient and will forever be grateful for this great doctor.  ,Male
Dr. Wachs is your typical bad doctor. It doesn't seem likes she cares about her patients. She actually walked out the door as I was asking her a question. Avoid.,Female
"Terrible. She has given me a 1500 bill that is in collections for a quick care visit. It now sits in my credit report, office unwilling to solve.  She is rude, her staff is rude, and she's just thirsty for that paper.",Female
They don't know how to bill insurance correctly and this is a common dilemma for them. ,Female
"She is very by the books. If you have a straight forward case and want to do the 3 months Clomid, 3 months IUI, (maybe injectables), and then IVF, she will get you there. If you want to discover the reason for your infertility, or your case is less straightforward, she will still go through that same system, you might end up pregnant or just confused and tired. I went to my Gyno and in one day he discovered a hostile CM problem that Dr. Wachs hadn' discovered in almosta year of working with me",Female
"I would not recommend this doctor. She doesn't believe Sjogren's can be serious. I tested positive for it and she didn't contact me with my results, I had to look on the portal. When I contacted her about concerns regarding lupus and RA and asked what I should do to follow up as next steps, she told me to follow up with my eye doctor. I feel incredibly marginalized, especially since my mother had serious autoimmune issues and died at age 63. This was not the right way to treat a patient. The only reason I'm giving her 1 star is because I wouldn't be able to write a review. I'm extremely disappointed and this appointment was a big waste of my time.",Female
"Sadly I had to choose 1 star because it would not allow me to leave a review. She should be called the ice queen because she has no bedside manner at all... I went to this Dr. for RA and she prescribed Methotrexate. At some point I heard a crackling in my chest when breathing and I ended up having Pulmonary Fibrosis from the medication. Imagine a Doctor taking your blood pressure and weighing you each visit but never putting a stethoscope to your chest to listen to your lungs. Her response was """,Female

All along he had cancer still remaining in his body . University hospital told us he was cancer free . After the transplant he passed away 3 months later . He talked great things about you .

Not impressed at all. Received no help for my allergies.,Male
"Dr. Wachsman is ok as a Doctor, but he has his own craziness going on.   He claims to take insurance, then when he gets declined because he doesn't submit claims in a timely manner he expects the client to pick up the bill.  Had over a year of claims that he submitted at one time and told me to pay because he only bills as a convenience, it wasn't his obligation to submit claims. He should have told me that he may/or may not submit my claims in a time frame that insurance would pay!",Male

He is caring and compassionate and by far the best psychopharmacologist I have been to. I have lost many jobs due to  severe anxiety and depression. I have been treated for these 2 conditions for over 20 years, yet have not improved. He listened to my symptoms and changed my diagnosis. The medication for this new diagnosis has completely changed my life.",Male
"I am 37 years old.  I was a patient of Dr. Watchman in my twenties.  If it weren't for him, I probably would be in some mental institute.  He guided me through a path of wellness.

I did tell dr,I hadn't been informed as to the after effects of the procedure and was afraid something was going wrong. Maybe that's why I'm no longer his patient? I truly am at a loss to understand this.",Male
"When I hurt my back, I was referred to this doctor. I wanted to avoid taking opiates, and he said he could help me, would help me. He sold me hope, 4 expensive 'interventional pain management procedures with copayments of 200.00 each When we ran out of options, and there were no more procedures to try, this Doctor didn't bother to show up for the final appointment, he sent an assistant, someone I'd never met. And when I finally did take pain medicine he asked who my doctor was, sneered at me, made a catty comment when I said her name, like he's above compassion or something. 

This was a long time ago, my back over time it healed, I got off opiates, but I'll always remember this experience.",Male

"DR. Wachsman is an extraordinary pain management specialist because he always seems to emphasize minimal to optimal interventions, avoiding the pitfalls of addictive or habit forming interventions as only an extreme option.

"If you want a smart knowledgeable Doctor with good old customer service,a Doctor who truly care about your health issues and will go above and beyond what any other Doctor would do..then Dr. Wachsman is the Doctor you have been looking for...I had been suffering severe back pain for over 20 years,it restricted every activity I used to enjoy,including full time work and playing baskerball,and referring basketball. Thank G-D I finally got to Dr. Wachsman's office and my life has changed completely",Male
Only dr in 15 who diagnosed and eliminated my pain,Male
"Called to make an appointment, receptionist was very rood on the phone, and asked me what is my first language, implying she can not understand ""accent"". She was very rood and hung up the phone.
Incident took place Tuesday, October 25 around 11:45 AM.
We will call the referring doctor's office to make sure they no longer refer any additional patients to this office.",Male
I would recommend Dr. Wachsman to anyone looking for pain relief.  I was having severe back pain when I went to see him and he helped me to be able to walk without pain.  ,Male
I would not go back to this office ever again. The office is over booked. The staff does not communicate well to the patient. They have the nerve to charge 100.00 if you don't cancel your appointment in 24 hours before.,Male
DR. WACHSMAN IS A KNOWLEDGEABLE AND CARING DOCTOR.   HIS STAFF IS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL.  ,Male
She is an excellent Dr. Very caring. She really looks out for her patients and goes the extra mile to make sure we are well taken care of. Ive been seeing her for 3 yrs now as a high risk for breast cancer. Her staff are all very kind and loving as well. I will reccomend her to everyone. Thank you for the awesome care i get from you and all your staff at Georgia Breast Care.,Female
She is a very nice and kind lady. She puts all her concern about. She wants you to feel all question and concerns are answered before you leave her office. Also her assistant Christy is a very nice lady as well. They are there for you and they make sure everything is checked 2 or 3 times for your peace of mind. I would highly recommend her to anyone.,Female
My wife has had 2 surgeries with Doctor Wachsmuth and both times when we arrived at the hospital at 5:30 in the morning - the procedures were not scheduled properly and we had to remind them about what was supposed to be done. Bedside manner is poor and level of professionalism is very poor. We are switching to a new practice.,Female
The experience that I had with Dr. Wachsmuth and her staff was the best that I think I have ever experienced with a doctor's office.  Everyone was so nice.  The information given to me was very thorough and all the staff that I encounter took their time with me.  I did not feel as though my appointment was rushed at all!  I would highly recommend this practice.   ,Female
"I rarely write reviews on anything, but I feel that everyone should know that Dr. Wachsmuth and all of her staff at Georgia Breast Care did an excellent job with prompt attention, good communication and great service.  I work in the healthcare industry, this office has exemplary standards.",Female
"I was there exactly 8 minutes late for an 8:30 appt, and they refused to do my tumor biopsy. I explained that I had simply passed the exit and it put me back, and they denied service. I even offered to sit in the waiting room all day until another patient blew their appointment and they said no. This is after I waited 45 mins for them to examine my chest days prior, and determined that my tumor is ""of concern."" Now I have to sit in my nervousness until I find another doctor.",Female
Most wonderful and caring dr that I have ever seen. I'm trying to find him.  Can anyone help me?,Male
"Dr. Wachspress is an excellent cardiologist. He puts thought and caring into everything he does. He's proven to be very thorough and accurate. When he's done taking care of you, he gives you time to ask all the questions you need, doesn't rush, and answers them in layman's terms, so we could understand. He saved my husband's life with his expert and accurate diagnoses. We highly recommend him.",Male
Dr Wachtel is very professional and easy for may son to speak with. He is understanding and listening to what my son says.,Male
I saw him many years ago.  He's good.  But I find it very odd that when you are paying (he used to charge an exorbitant amount of money) so much to see a psychiatrist in private practice that you need to wait way past your appt time.  And although the sessions were supposed to be 45 minutes he almost always cut them short and still charged the same.  I was just a teenager.  I wouldn't deal with that now.  He really likes to prescribe pills!,Male
"Dr. Wachtel diagnosed me several years ago with bronchiectisis. He went into little explanation nor did I have the wherewithal to question him at the time. Because I was never warned by him about the vulnerability of the likelihood of colonized pseudomonas, I now have stage 4 COPD. My quality of life is compromised beyond measure. I have been to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester and there is virtually nothing to be done for me and this progressive disease. I cannot say if this situation could have been avoided, but I can say Dr. Wachtel should have taken the time to explain to me what could happen ( and did), and any possible ways to minimize the risks. I do not like this doctor, his office is chaos, and he should retire. I prefer to remain anonymous but if anyone has a question about my story, I will gladly reply.",Male
Very good ,Male
"Rude staff-- terrible policy. Needed to get in urgently and receptionist told me Dr. Watchel was on vacation. I asked to see someone else in his office and they said no one else is taking his patients so go to the hospital or urgent care. No one seems to care about your health or patronage. Felt like trying to get into a second rate hollywood club, not a health care professional. Staff at desk is always rude and be doctor would often oddly snap at me if I would ask a question.",Male
"I have had a great relationship with Dr. Wachtel. She is a kind, caring and sensitive professional. She is very personable and easy to talk to. She always listens to me and helps me to live a more fulfilling life. I highly recommend her. I am very lucky I found her.",Female
"My experience seeing Dr Wachtel ranged from unpleasant to downright terrifying. 

Dr Wachtel claims to be LGBTQ informed and yet asks invasive, inappropriate questions that proves that she has had no sensitivity training to speak of. I found her to be judgmental and project her own personal ideas of sexuality and gender onto me. All of which was wildly unprofessional.

The terrifying came in the form of the medication she prescribed me. I had already been previously diagnosed with a mood disorder and communicated my negative experiences with SSRIs. She however insisted that an SNRI was different. It was different...in that a single dose triggered one of the most harrowing mixed episodes of my life. I could have died, and I mean that honestly. Even the doctor I saw at urgent care knew that Dr Wachtel made an obviously terrible decision with her choice in medication. TLDR: she’s a terrible doctor. ",Female
"I wish I could put in words how much I value Dr. Wachtel.  I am so lucky to have found her when I need help the most in my life.  I have found her to be compassionate and caring as well as very knowledgeable with DBT and medication management (especially for those with addictive issues).  In the short time I have been working with her she has taught me coping skills to deal with early sobriety and all that comes with it.  I could not be going through this without her and though I do the work, she guide me and offers different ways on how I may approach it and think about it in new light.",Female
"As a New Yorker of 10 years, I have been through a good amount of mental health professionals and it is so rewarding to find one that is so ready to go on the journey with you to make you a better version of yourself. I have only been with Dr Anna Wachtel for less than 3 months and I already have a list of accomplishments, and I have friends and family telling me how I have my old “Pep in my step” coming back! I am so excited I found her and if you’re in need, stop searching! She is truly the most welcoming, caring individual who will hold you accountable and help you reach your goals.",Female
Dr. Anna Wachtel has helped me tremendously over the few months since I've met with her. She listens and regularly checks in with how I'm doing. I also feel like she genuinely cares about my well being and gets excited about my development. Every psychiatrist approaches therapy differently and I'm grateful that Dr. Wachtel and I get along so well and that she is able to really pinpoint what I'm going through.,Female
"My experience with Dr. Wachtel is very positive.  It usually take a couple of visits before I can tell if she is good for me.  At this point, it's almost 3 months that I have been seeing her and I like her approach on her treatment for mental problems.  She incorporate holistic approach with science and that's what struck me.  She is not only treating you with medication but is also interested in knowing what is going on with the other functions of you body.  I really like her.",Female
"I came to Dr. Wachtel suffering from alcoholism, opioid addiction and crippling anxiety. I was always wary of psychiatrists before Dr. Wachtel because of the impersonal manner in which they treated my psychiatric illnesses and their judgement based off of self identifying as a transgender woman. Dr. Wachtel adjusted my medication, convinced me to join an AA program tailored towards the LGBTQ+ community, start dating again and pursue my passion for writing. Thank you for everything Dr. Wachtel!",Female
"Dr. Wachtel is very caring and knowledgeable. I went in, and from the beginning she knew exactly what was wrong and how to help.  I have been seeing her for over a year and have never felt better. ",Female
"Worst psychiatrist I’ve ever met. Rude, money-driven, should have her license ripped away from her. Is not there to genuinely help. NOT A SAFE SPACE BEWARE",Female
"Dr. Wachtel is great psychiatrist , listens carefully to her patients and includes me in treatment decisions. She likes to follow up and check how her patients are doing. She’s very knowledgeable and  kind and caring psychiatrist.",Female
"I really like her.. And I trust her expertise on treatment. If you are looking for real concrete help, then she is it. Safe treatment, great and realistic advice. I highly recommend Dr. Wachtel.",Female
"Dr Wachtel is so kind and is slowly but surely bringing me back to life. I am so grateful I found her. She is such a great listener. Her office is very clean, quiet and calming. We are never interrupted during our sessions and I never feel rushed. I would absolutely recommend her to others looking to better themselves.",Female
"I feel so lucky that I am seeing Dr. Wachtel! I couldn't have asked for a more attentive, sweet, easy to open up to and professional. She truly made a huge difference in my life and I can't thank her enough. ",Female
"Dr. Wachtel has changed my life. Mental illness is truly a disease and needs to be treated. I know in my experience both through medication and continued therapy. Dr. Wachtel has helped me face deep rooted issues of mine and learn the truth about myself which has improved my relationships and standard of living - for which I’m grateful. 

Cheers!",Female

Doctor Anna Wachtel did miracles on me! I was like a dad person and I got my life back! My wife can't thank her enough! I have some physical issued like heart problem and without me asking she was very responsible to keep in touch with other doctors to make sure that the medicine she prescribes me fits my physical situation.

"Dr Wachtel finishes every question withg you know
She does listen to patients
The worse MD that I ever ssen ",Female
"The absolute worst- I wish I could give zero stars. Unprofessional, callous, curt, and completely disconnected from reality. She is rude, unapologetic, and prefers to have her patients rely on outside doctors (i.e. psychologists, neurologists, internalists- all of which she's requested I get tests from) to do her job. Only accepts cash for copayments and takes notes on random pieces of loseleaf paper. Oh and there are dog wee-wee pads in the office. ",Female
"When I first started seeing Dr. Wachtel I was suffering with bipolar disorder. After detoxing me from the medication that my previous psychiatrist hooked me on, she worked with me to find the medication that suited my health and work habits. She is a great listener and gives excellent advice on leading a healthy, happy life. I am grateful for Dr. Wachtel and I wouldn't be as happy as I am today without her treating me.",Female
I have seen such a huge turnaround in the anxiety and depression that I have been living with for so long. Dr. Wachtel has been caring and receptive with my needs for my medication. She believes deeply in providing safe and effective medical and therapy resolutions. ,Female
Saw Wachtel  for over  20 years.   Reported  my father’s history of male breast cancer. He documented in my chart but NEVER referred me to a genetic counselor.  Male breast cancer is strongly linked to BRCA mutation. I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer caused by the BRCA mutation  and have been battling the disease for last 5.5 years with a poor chance of survival.  I could have had prophylactic surgery when I decided to not have another child 20 years ago if Wachtel ever bothered to read my chart.  His incompetence has cost me my life.,Male
"I been seeing Dr. Wachtel every week for 2 months for a planter wart i was hesitated to any doctor because of the covid but after going to him i was very happy because he did an excellent job with me and i would recommend him to anyone.

"Was treated for  neuropathy, would highly recommend Dr. Wachtel's treatment.
Am walking better. Has treatment for all foot problems.",Male
Dr. Wachtel has been treating me for about two years now in conjunction with the wound clinic saved for my big toe from amputation. I see him routinely for diabetic foot care anf  he is always professional and personable and his office staff are outstanding. I managed a cardiology practice and I know what good service is. I would not consider any other podiatrist in the area.  He is outstanding and I do not use that term lightly.,Male
I went to this doctor for a second opinion after going to another doctor who didn't help me at all.Right away he put me an injection after seen my x rays. One day and i feel almost 100%.i will highly recommended him.,Male

"Dr. Wachter is the most conscientious, competent, experienced and trustworthy doctor I've known. He has an excellent demeanor, is extremely knowledgeable in his field and serves as speaker and consultant to various immunology organizations.

I personally can't think of a more qualified doctor or anyone else I'd rather have as a resource and allergist.",Male
"Dr Wachter was catching things my PCP was missing, has taken me off meds, or switched me to something more suitable. Now I've been taken off meds for cholesterol and diabetes permanently. She has been working with other specialists I'm seeing, so they can better treat me. Currently, I see her for only two medical conditions, and one of them I no longer take medication for, but still needs to be monitored. She encouraged me in my weight loss journey, and pointed out how my lab results continued to improve as the lbs came off. Now I am at a healthy weight and BMI, and cholesterol and blood sugar are normal as well. If you are willing to do your part, she will support you. If you just want meds thrown at you, and are unwilling to make the changes you need, don't expect her to not say anything, or not be blunt about it. She is very good at what she does, but noncompliance of the patient hinders her ability.",Female
Dr. Wachter is great.  She listens and remembers without having to remind her even if there has been a lapse of time between visits.  This demonstrates her interest in her patients.  I willingly travel quite a distance to visit with Dr. Wachter because she is THAT much of a great doctor!  She explains health information and gives her professional opinion so that the patient can decide which route to take.  I fully trust and highly recommend her.,Female
One of the best doctors in my 77 years! Highly recommend.,Female
I Dont have any experience with Dr. Wachter. Today 12/03/2018 I called for an appointment and was given Sept 21 2019 I asked if that was a joke and was told it was not.,Female
One of my favorite doctors ,Female
"If I could give her zero stars, I would. She was not thorough or caring at all within the visits I had with her. She put no effort into getting to the root on my problem ",Female
"Dr. Wachter spent more time with me than she needed to, making sure to answer all my questions, provide additional information, and develop a personal relationship with me as a patient. Her attentiveness and level of knowledge helped me to feel comfortable and confident in her abilities. She was able to diagnosis me and provide a road to recovery when several other doctors I visited before her had failed.",Female
Dr. Wachter is awesome!  She is smart and very attentive.  Dr. Wachter is very serious about what is going on and what is going to make things better.  I value her opinion and I take heed when she gives me her advice.  Our first meeting was not the greatest but I later found out that she is serious about what she does and was not there to play and joke with me.  She is very passionate about what she does. She doesn't even know I had a problem with our first visit.  She was doing what she does! ,Female
"I highly recommend Dr. Wachter, and I have to many people.  Dr. Wachter helped me get my life back after a depression hit me last summer. I was so afraid to take medicine. Dr. Wachter is one of very few psychiatrists who do a gene test if you request it. It was the best thing I did because after the results came in she used the report to get me on the right medication.I was so afraid. She eased my fear.I trusted her.She really has great insight and expertise. She helped me get my life back.",Female
"I saw Dr. Wachter for a period of 5-8 years, for individual therapy, group therapy and cognitive therapy.  She is a kind, compassionate person with laser-sharp insight.",Female

"Dr. Wachter is by far and long the best psychiatrist I have ever had. I was recommended him by a friend's after I changed cities after a divorce, and he helped me through a lot of changes. He always listens to you, which seems rare in his profession. He always answers all your questions and spends the full appointment time with you; he's very thorough. I recommend him to anyone in the peninsula.",Male
"Awesome... He saved my life--literally!
I was one of his first patients during Residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore MD",Male
I had a lithotripsy done by Dr. Wachterman.  I have had this procedure before &amp; the procedure didn't differ from the previous time.  But the post-op experience was the best urologic care I've had. (And that spans decades.)  From a painless cystoscopy to an unhurried time to answer my questions. Everything was professional &amp; helpful for my particular circumstances.,Male
"I have an enlarge prostate, and I saw Dr. Wachterman about a procedure it does called Rezum.  He explained the procedure, and did some followup tests to see if I was a candidate.  I was, and he consequently did the procedure.  Everything sent exactly as Dr. Wachterman explained, and his approach is very open and I felt completely comfortable asking him all the questions I wanted.  He was very patient and addressed all of my concerns.  His office staff for the pre and post op visits were also excellent.  I would recommend him very highly.",Male
"I've always had great experiences with Dr. Kathleen Wachtler! Thanks to her on my first visit, a physical no less that took an hour as she's very thorough told me I was not managing my asthma well! I'd told her what other doctors prescribed for me, finding out it was way to much to take! After that I cut out one medication and cut back on the other and I feel fantastic. She's a good doctor all the way around because she asks questions and logs all anwsers you provide so there's never a question as I have a complete history! Go Dr. Wachtler",Female
"Oh please, Dr. Wachtler, if she can even be called a doctor, was orginally a audiologist!! 
Sorry, but she is the worse of the worse. I have had the best of the best from New York, California to Mayo and how this Wachtler could even be a doctor befuddles me in the short time of extensive education to be an MD. 
I might as well study online, get an online plaque and call myself a doctor.",Female
"I visited her a few times.  My criticism is that she seems less than confident, a little nervous, less than knowledgable and therefor wants to refer many her patients to other MDs rather than treating the problem.  I also think she is constantly thinking in terms of not getting into trouble or not getting sued, rather her patient's best interest,",Female
"A prompt office visit was scheduled when I called; as a first time patient, the paperwork I  needed for my visit was immediately emailed to me. Office receptionist was friendly and professional. Parking accommodations are excellent. Office is exceptionally clean.
Dr. Wachtler preformed a VERY thorough examination and provided me with detailed information and treatment plan for my ailment. I was VERY impressed.",Male

"This office operates like an extremely well-oiled machine. This was not a procedure I wanted to be left in a room thinking about, and I wasn't. Dr. Wachtler was attentive, informative, and precise, all while maintaining a conversation to keep me at ease. Comparing my procedure to friends and associates, I can unequivocally say that I made the correct decision to go to him. My only regret is trying to fix my issue on my own and not seeing Dr. Wachtler immediately. ",Male
"Excellent doctor, spends time with you, explains in detail and in English.  If you have a foot/ankle problem I would suggest you make an appt. you won't be disappointed.",Male

Dr. Wachtman took his time at each visit. Answered all of our concerns/questions. He was extremely patient with my elderly mother. ,Male
"Two years ago Dr. Wachtman truly saved my foot if not more.  Infection had set in and hospital staff bewildered for 24 hours until they called Dr. Wachtman in.  Diagnosed, treated, and grafted damaged area, and besides great medical care, multiple visits, including Fathers Day, to inform and check in.  Outstanding bedside manners.  Long time coming but well deserved.",Male
"Unfortunately never got a chance to meet Dr Wachtmeister.  I made an appointment 4 months ago for today.  When I called to confirm, Linda told me she cancelled my appointment.  The reason:  they received a request for my medical records.  I asked if they had my records and Linda said no they did not since I was a new patient.  Linda informed me that their policy is to cancel appointments when this occurs since she assumed that I no longer plan to go to Dr. Wachtmeister.  So, the patient, me, was not informed of any of this until I called to ask about my appointment.  Disappointing that communication is not important for this practice!",Female
"not only is she a very caring doctor she also takes the time to get to know you and you to know her. she creates a very positive, comfortable, and friendly environment that put you at ease speaking with her. i have been a patient of hers for years now she is not only a very good doctor but a truly quinine person deserving of ones trust, appreciation, and respect. her personality makes you feel that you are not only seeing your doctor but a caring friend as well.

"Doctor Wack is an incredible doctor with a warm, kind and down-to- earth personality. ",Male
"Took 2 months to get in to see this doctor and when I finally had my appointment day the doctor seemed like he was wore out. He’s a bigger man, which isn’t a problem, but when you’re a doctor shouldn’t you have some sense of personal hygiene? He came into the room smelling like he hadn’t showered in days, his hair was unkept, his shirt unpressed and for looking like Santa Claus, wasn’t a very jovial person at all. He was not able to give a clear answer to my ailment. Looking for a new doctor now",Male
Never got the chance,Male
"I only saw him on two occasions. First was consultation and was referred to specialist at Roswell. Second visit was to follow up on test performed at Roswell. Was told to come back for colonoscopy is few months. I called for appointment only to hear message the office was closed that dr Wacker was now in with another practice. 
I was never notified by mail that this occurred months prior to this call. Totally unprofessional!",Male

"My internist of many years whom I loved moved out of state so I chose to set up a new patient appointment with her. My previous PCP wasn't a St John doctor so I tried explaining my medical history but she seemed completely uninterested and looked on her computer for the entire appointment. I left with unanswered questions, no refills on my meds and no plan for lab work(which my previous doctor insisted be done every 6 months) or any follow-up care. I left feeling completely ignored and uncared for.",Female
" After she suggested I stop my antidepressant cold turkey, without any weaning off whatsoever, I realizd she knew othing about antidepressants. When I expressed a concern the side effects of doing this to my mental health she suggested if I had a problem to go to Laureate Hospital. This is unacceptable!

Not only does she not know what she is talking about, but I don’t think she listens or cares.",Female
"I failed to make my initial appointment because of extenuating circumstances, I not only was black balled from trying to reschedule but blacked balled from making an appointment with another associate physician.

"This doctor is the most unprofessional doctor I have ever encountered. He was forced upon us at JMC. He is disrespectful &amp; doesn't abide by rules (POA &amp; medical directives), &amp; makes snide comments re: family dynamics. He doesn'tt explain his decisions, nor consult patient's family as directed by law, in our case, nor does he read &amp; understand patient chart. We not only would NEVER recommend him, we will likely file a formal complaint about him to the proper governing body.",Male
"Dr. Wacks takes care of my elderly mother. She has a host of medical problems, medications, and specialists. With her previous physician, every time I would call about an issue, they would just ship me off to the ER or to another specialist for another medication. Dr. Wacks listens to what I am saying, looks at this issue in context of my mother as a whole person, and makes a thoughtful treatment plan. With him, I am not alone as I help my mother through her end-of-life care.",Male
"I had HORRIBLE hot flashes when I went through menopause. Dr. Wacks talked to me about natural bioidentical hormones, which worked great and I personally feel better about in terms of potential side effects. Highly recommend!",Male
"Dr. Wacks is awesome, you better call him right now because his practice is going to fill up in no time.",Male
Never in my life have I received such a level of care for so little money. I could not be happier to have Dr. Wacks as my personal physician.,Male
"I would highly recommend Dr. Wacks to anyone in need of a new PCP. He is on the younger side, but he uses this to his advantage as he is energetic, passionate, and up to date on current practice. If we get a new generation of doctors like him, we will be in good shape!",Male
"Dr. Wacks has the unique combination of characteristics in that he is BOTH extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, as well as he is empathetic and kind. He is truly doing what he was meant to do.",Male
Dr. Wacks really cares about me and thinks deeply about my case. I will never go anywhere else.,Male
"I had my yearly “physical” from my boat. We did it by video (Zoom). I sent him my vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, weight, etc). We discussed all of my concerns, went over my labs in detail, and made a treatment plan. I have to say, NOTHING was lost by doing it virtually, and the convenience factor is unbelievable. Keep up the great work PDFM!",Male
"Dr. Wacks diagnosed me with COVID-19 as an outpatient in the Spring of 2020. I was so scared, I thought I was going to die! Dr. Wacks was so good, he did not over-react, but he also did not under-react. He diagnosed me quickly, got me the X-ray I needed, and started me on medications early. He was available frequently to check-in with me as I recovered. I am so thankful to have him as my doctor, I trust him with my life.",Male
"His Functional Medicine approach to chronic disease management and wellness is extraordinary. Sometimes we need medications, but he will first try to get to the root of the problem and solve the core issue with nutritional and lifestyle interventions. I feel like I am an overall healthier person since starting to see him.",Male
"If you want typical, sub-par, assembly-line type primary care go wherever you like. That is probably fine if you never need anything. If you want patient-centered, responsive, high-quality care primary care, check out Dr. Wacks at PatriotDirect Family Medicine!",Male
Dr. Wacks is the Best!,Male
Dr. Wacks is the Best! definitely recommend to others,Male
Dr Wacks has been seeing my children since they were born.  I can call or text him 24/7. Do video appointments. Message pictures.  It is awesome how flexible they are and how good the communication is.,Male
"I was in the hospital a few months ago for pneumonia.  Dr. Wacks was texting me the whole time, making sure I was feeling better and talking to the doctors.  He really takes the time and advocates for his patients.",Male
My Kids love coming to see Dr Wacks!,Male
Such a great attitude and bedside manner.  HE really cares about my health and wellbeing,Male
"Awful experience.  He completely mismanaged my care and that caused other medical issues for me. He has no humility,  has no bedside manner and I would never recommend him to anyone.",Male
"he is sometimes reliable and sometimes not reliable.

The worst part of his practice is that no-one ever picks up the phone. And I don't call him often, perhaps twice/year; it takes his office a few of days to respond. The office overall or practice, if you will does not seem overall professional in that regard. He sees people at his home and the office just seems like it is there as a formality. He otherwise seems like a nice person.",Male
Absolutely amazing physician. She is so sweet and caring. Best GYN I've ever come into contact with. I heard she's leaving my area but I'm thinking about following her for all of me and daughter's GYN needs. I would and have recommended her to anyone. THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!,Female
Very professional; easy to talk to; she spends as much time with patient as needed...I never felt rushed; doctors don't come any nicer that Dr. Wacks; she never criticizes or condemns; always encourages and builds up her patients.,Female
Cannot say enough good things about Dr Wackym! Had been to several ENT's who were unable to help my vertigo. Dr Wachym diagnosed my vestibular migranes and set me on the path to feeling better!!,Male
I can’t even say how grateful we are to Dr Wackym we have been looking for someone to help our son for 17 years after two tests he new it was SSCD recommended surgery and my son is doing great.  He was great with us and my son as was his staff all explained and questions answered.,Male
"Dr. Wackym took my daughter seriously and listened carefully without judgement to the list of unusual symptoms she was experiencing. Finally a doctor that didn’t automatically say that everything she was going through was psychological. She was eventually diagnosed with a perilymph fistula and after undergoing surgery, she literally got her life back.",Male
"Dr. Wackym is an excellent surgeon.  I followed Dr. Wackym from Portland to New Brunswick and he has operated on me 3 times.  I couldn't be happier with the results, his skill and his knowledge-base.  I highly recommend Dr. Wackym!",Male
"I cannot give enough praise for Dr. Wackym! Between 2014 &amp; 2018 I have had 2 SSCD surgeries and (then due to a car accident) surgery for cochlear facial nerve dehiscence. His knowledge and skill has been beyond exceptional! I believe that the reason he's so amazing is because (there's no doubt) you can see he truly cares about his patients. His skillful hands have changed many lives for the better and helped his patients return to the ""quality of life"" everyone so deserves. Dr. Wackym is THE MOST compassionate doctor/surgeon I've ever met!",Male
"We had an amazing experience with Dr.Wackym using him for our sons Coclear implants. He was passionate, answered all our questions with patience and utmost professionalism and guided us through the process step by step. We are extremely grateful to him.",Male
"We were referred to Dr Wackym by a dr friend and we cannot thank them both enough. Dr W correctly diagnosed our son for EVA and progressive hearing loss. He did our son’s cochlear implant surgery 4 months ago and now our son who had lost all his words by the time he turned 2 is picking up words at an excellent pace. Dr is highly knowledgeable. He has excellent bedside manners. Possess great surgical skills. He is easy to communicate with. Understands the urgency for proper treatment.
He has always shown genuine care towards our son. We will be going back to Dr Wackym for my son’s cochlear implant surgery in the other ear before end of this year.
I will highly recommend Dr Wackym",Male
"I had seen several doctors before being referred to Dr. Wackym, he was the first person to successfully diagnose me.  I was a complicated case, and he never gave up on my care.  I can not say enough positive things about him.",Male
"After 7 years of our son suffering daily from vertigo (constantly feeling like ground was moving beneath him), migraines (meds offered no relief) and seizure activity (not controlled by meds) , visits to more Drs &amp; Hospitals that we can recall, we finally were referred to Dr Wackym. Within 6 weeks our son was seen, tested, had a follow up visit, and was recovering from surgery. Dr Wackym changed our son’s life, he has been vertigo, migraine, and seizure free for over two years and we are forever indebted to him!! Dr Wackym, his staff, the nurses, the surgical staff are all so kind, compassionate, attentive, intelligent and knowledgeable. You will never regret trusting in Dr Wackym or his staff.",Male
Was able to evaluate and treat our daughter after numerous doctors and even two neurologists were unable to find causes of illness. Would not hesitate at all in recommending Dr Wackym,Male
"Dr. Wackym listened completely and offered real hope. Before seeing him, I had no quality of life because of dizziness, headaches, nausea, light sensitivity, and tullio. Many other specialists ignored symptoms, repeatedly misdiagnosed me, and offered inappropriate medication. Dr. Wackym took everything seriously and had the skill to fix problems. I felt very safe having him do surgery and the results were better than expected.",Male
Dr. Wackym literally saved my son’s quality of life. Before surgery he was unable to cope with every day life. He had constant vertigo and migraines and couldn’t attend seventh grade. After surgery he was better than ever and 5 years later has gotten a scholarship to play D1 lacrosse at University of Hartford. We can’t thank Dr. Wackym and his team enough.,Male
"he explained this weird &amp; annoying SCD thing i seem to have gotten as a result of a traumatic brain injury i experienced last yr in a way that was clear &amp; respectful of my experience. he was more thorough than the 4 previous ENT docs we tried, who dismissed my symptoms &amp; did NOT give us confidence in their skills. we were impressed with the staff as well-they made the process easier &amp; streamlined it for us, bless them. no one wants surgery, but if you have to have it, we feel good about Dr.W.",Male
"After years of being dizzy and off balance (and not being able to drive), Dr. Wackym (or Dr. Wonderful as I call him), knew within five-minutes what was probably wrong with me!  And he was absolutely correct.  I had surgery in July 2015 to fill a 6mm hole in my inner ear.  Less than a year later I was driving again, no longer needed a walker or cane to get around, and my fibromyalgia pain levels even dropped.  Dr. Wackym saved my life! I owe so much to this man. You can TRUST him with your life!",Male
"Dr. Wackym truly listened and took my whole medical history into account. He did thorough testing and made sure I was able to understand my options and what was to be expected pre and post surgery. He and his staff were accessible and very patient as I asked a multitude of questions. During my appointments, I was able to ask all my questions without feeling rushed.",Male
"He was my son’s neurologist while he was in UW Hospital for aspiration pneumonia due to vomiting/aspirating while seizing. Dr Waclawic was sincerely interested, I like him, but my concern is that he knew little to nothing of seizures, much less the rare, life-threatening seizure disorder called Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome that my son suffers with. Why would they assign a non-epilepsy neurologist to a patient with such a rare, complicated seizure disorder? Isn’t that malpractice, when I KNOW they have epileptologists on staff? (Is it because my son has Medicaid due to being disabled?) How can I have confidence in Dr Waclawik or his treatment or opinions regarding my son’s very unusual and life-threatening condition? He clearly didn’t understand how Medicaid works, and as his English wasn’t great it was clear he was “new”. UWHospital just wanted to cut corners with my son’s care because they don’t profit enough from treating a Medicaid patient. That’s what his 21 day hospital stay taught me.",Male
"Dr. Waclawik is a great primary care. He is very kind and understanding, and takes his time getting to know his patients, as well as listening to their concerns. The office staff is also very friendly and prompt!",Male
Great listener &amp; very kind.,Male
"I'd never seen a Cardiologist before Dr. Wada. I can't express how at ease he made me feel right away! I admit I was apprehensive! Dr. Wada  spoke softly yet matter of fact, stopping when I asked, he made me feel confident in his knowledge, (never like I was uneducated because I didn't quite understand), he took the time to explain in non medical terms! I was 68, newly relocated to Ohio after being recently widowed &amp; retired!  I am keeping Dr. Wada, as he's the best, just ask my grand kids!",Male
"Dr Xanthopoulos oversaw the various anaesthesiologists that treated me on a regular basis for the past 3 months, he provided advice and was kind and quick to help me deal with my phobias in a pre-operation setting. I rarely have met so personable and capable a Dr in the anaesthesia field.",Male
"First of all, she doesn't think Dis-associative Identity Disorder is real. She is the type that will diagnose you within the first five minutes of seeing you without looking at you. A real piece of work.",Female
She over prescribed medication to my son to the point where he abused and sold the drugs and she did nothing about it.,Female
"An incredible, perceptive and attentive Doctor! ",Male
"I had a stroke in 2017 and Dr Xavier was the Neuro Surgeon on call that night at St Joseph Mercy.  He performed an embolectomy on me and saved my life. I am totally thankful and appreciative of him. He continues to monitor me now and I have basically fully recovered now. 
Quite a journey and I am very happy to have Dr Xavier watching me.",Male
He saved my husbands life after he suffered a stroke. He was very professional and took the time to discuss everything with me.,Male
"Dr.Xavier saved my life. At the beginning he never knew me from the man on the moon. He perform a life saving surgery for me. He explained everything he had done to me and showed me pictures of my brain. I remember I was feeling bad for myself because of my incident but he kept smiling as he always does and reassured me that I was doing very good. He has a very bubbly personality. He showed personal affection for me and made me feel like I was not just a number in his daily patient routine. I recall when he did a procedure for me, after the procedure he checked on me several times to make sure I was doing just fine. When you see him he brightens up your day with a beautiful smile. I grew to love him. I trust everything he does. His assistant is one of the best she also takes a personal interest in everyone she comes across. I promise you that Dr. Xavier is excellent at what he does. I couldn’t ask for a better Neurologist hands down!!!",Male
I had a stroke in 2013 and Dr. Xavier performed the surgery to put a stent in .  He was wonderful and very focused in what he had to do.,Male
Was a very scary experience made a whole lot calmer by a great doctor Thank you Dr Xavier and Staff,Male
"HELP!!! I'm giving it a ""fair"" because Dr. Xavier himself is good but his staffing is horrible. They have rescheduled on my dad last minute, completely cancelled last minute, mixed up his locations &amp; dropped appointments out of nowhere. It started where we wouldn't find out changes until we arrived for the appointment. Then it went to confirming &amp; still changing last minute. Now the office is too busy to answer calls the last 3 days. Feeling extremely helpless about my dad's health support.",Male
"Since my dad's stroke in January, his appts have been re-scheduled or cancelled by Dr. Xavier's office on 5 separate occasions. We have driven to all office locations only to be turned away bc he was at a different office, or not there at all.Conflicting/False info. was confirmed repeatedly, with no direct line or means of contacting him. I've talked to his staff to rectify this w/o any reasonable solution. If you can see a different doc, do it. Otherwise, prepare to waste time @ the last minute",Male
I felt I was in very skilled hands!,Male
"""Thank you for everything you have done for me! You are wonderful, caring doctor who was always friendly and comforting to your patients. Keep smiling and keep doing what you do so well. You truly make a difference in the medical field with your amazing staff.",Female
"Dr.  Xavier takes the time to listen to her patients concerns and treats her patients wonderfully.  She takes the time to make you feel like you are her only patient. 
 She doesn't stop until she finds what is causing your problem.   I even referred my mother to her. She is by far the best doctor I have ever had and I have many medical issues.  She had extensive knowledge of my many rare conditions and kept me in great shape.  Unfortunately I had to move to another state.  The medical care I am receiving  here is no where near as good as the care I received from Dr. Xavier.  I  trust her thoroughly.  She is the best !",Female
Dr. Xavier is wonderful.  She came to visit me when I was hospitalized.  I was so happy to see her.  I was afraid and she made my day. She goes over and beyond.  Love her!,Female
"This is the worst doctor I have ever met! I went to her on Feb 6th, 2020 for a physical and I complained of chest pains. She focused more on about what she was charging my insurance. She said I wasn’t eligible for a physical b/c it wasn’t a year(lie. I can have one each CALENDAR YEAR). Instead of giving me an EKG (she said there wasn’t one in the office), she wrote me up for a stress test, that was denied b/c prior approval was needed. She took over a week and a half and still had NO answers for me. When I got upset, she told me I was being unreasonable but I’m the one having chest pains! I ended up going to ER and they gave me an EKG and it turns out I had a pulled muscle! THANK GOD I wasn’t having a heart attack b/c I would be dead. She didn’t advise me to go to the ER or anything. However, she made SURE to charge me $152.00 for the office visit where all she did was take blood to check my A1C.  A REAL QUACK! If I could give her ZERO STARS I WOULD! I DO NOT RECOMMEND HER TO ANYONE!!!",Female
"Lovely woman
Wonderful doctor",Female
"My husband and I are both patients of Dr. Xavier and we are extremely pleased with her caring and dedication to our health concerns.  She spends ample time with us in our visits to listen to all our concerns, explain everything we need to know and answer all our questions.  We never feel rushed as has been our experience with other doctors.  ",Female
"Doctor Xavier in my opinion is certainly most insightful and delightful, and her expertise is unparalleled! 
I can't say enough about her. This doctor i would recommend to anyone with absolutely no reservations! 
God bless,
Eric
P.S. Dr. Kadambi was my doctor in Saginaw Mi. I very much appreciate her taking me in to her practice as a patient even though I was unable to get her. She recommended Dr. Xavier as an alternative to her and was very pleased she did.
Eric",Female
"The best ever, I love her great doctor.",Female
"I would highly reccomend her. I have a a few internists and she is by and far the best. Nice manor, very knowledgable and has helpful staff.",Female
"I moved here from Sugar Land. I Had a great specialist. When I started looking for doctors for my Crohns, I went to two different doctors before I found Dr, Xavier. I am so thankful I did. I would recommend him in a heart beat. very attentive. I left there feeling heard. ",Male
"Dr. Xavier was great, takes the time to explain and answer questions, has great staff that walked me through every step before the procedure.  Great experience. Highly recommend!",Male
5 Stars for Dr. Xavier,Male
"Dr. Xavier is extremely knowledgeable, a good listener and very easy to talk to.  I’ve had several procedures that he’s performed and was very well pleased.  His staff is friendly and runs the office very smoothly.",Male
Dr. Xavier out sourced me to another doctor because his practice does not give the medication I need.  Once I was out sourced I have had NO contact with Xavier's office until a year or so after being out sourced I have been contacted to make another appointment with him.  He did not follow up after recommending me to have a colonoscopy.,Male
"Dr.Xavier is awesome! Other doctors speak very highly of him. He treats my daughter. It can be difficult to get ahold of his office at times because they are very busy,but he is such a great doctor that it’s worth it. ",Male
"Worst experience ever! Would never refer this entire office to anyone! Dr. Xavier was very short and uncaring regarding my condition. His nurse Shawna was very rude to me as well, and cancelled an upcoming procedure after our phone conversation. I specifically told her not to cancel anything until I got back in touch with her, and she cancelled anyway. This is very unprofessional, and I will be pursuing her actions further. Stay away! Better doctors and office staff elsewhere!",Male
"I've been seeing Dr. Xavier for a few months now and I really like him. He's easy to talk to, listens to you and  works with you to determine the best course of treatment for your symptoms, and makes sure you are comfortable with the course of action.",Male
A great experience all around.,Male
Dr. Xavier is very caring and speaks in terms we can understand. I have been seeing him for several years and my husband also goes to him,Male
Felt very comfortable with Dr. Xavier and staff. Was very thorough and spent alot of time with me. Helped me with my bladder problem. Would highly recommend.,Male
Had a very good visit. His staff is nice and office large and clean. We discussed options for my bladder and prostate. Gave options and I am thinking over. Medications and surgery are options. I like him and trust him. Would recommend to friends and family.,Male
"Xavier performed a sling procedure on my mother back in February of this year (2019), nearly a year ago. My mother has been complaining of issues ever since, however, Xavier’s office seems to be refusing to do anything to help her. She has been prescribed antibiotics several times, despite being told that her urine was free of infection during her most recent visit. His assistant is rude and unprofessional, and the office even “lost” my mother’s file and had no idea what was going on with her. I would never recommend a dismissive doctor such as Xavier who does not advocate for his patients.",Male
Dr. Xavier was very knowledgeable. He answered all of my questions and took time to explain my issues. I would highly recommend Dr. Xavier to anyone.,Male
"Great and knowledgeable doctor. He doesn't rush you, he takes time listening to you and explain in detail what's going on with your symptoms.  Very friendly and human. He understands that every patient is different. I went there for unexplained pelvic pain. He sent me to  PT with a great therapist that helped tremendously.
Note: since he takes a lot of time wich each patient, you may wait longer than expected, but I don't care because that's mean he takes evert case seriously. ",Male
I just moved from Midland and was looking for an urologist. I read several good reviews on  Dr. Xavier so I made an appointment.  I certainly was not disappointed. Dr. Xavier lived up to his reputation. He was friendly .. Generally concerned.. Listened carefully and answered all of my questions. He was so kind and patient.  I left so relived and he put all my concerns at rest. He assured me that if I had any questions at all to just call him anytime. That is rare to find! I highly recommend him!,Male
"Referred to Dr Xavier by another Urologist. He is amazing, takes lots of time to explain issues. Highly recommend!
",Male
"I WAS REFERRED TO DR XAVIER. FIRST UROLOGIST I'VE SEEN. UPON ARRIVING AT THE OFFICE, THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE DESK WERE EXTREMELY COURTEOUS, PROVIDED ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS AND THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE WAITING ROOM WAS RELAXING.  WHEN I MET THE DOCTOR, HE MADE ME FEEL WELCOMED, AT EASE AND A MAN THAT WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO MY QUESTIONS.
THE PROCEDURES HE FELT NECESSARY WERE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL.  WHEN GOING THROUGH THE PROCEDURES, I WAS AT EASE, DUE TO HIS PERSONALITY.
RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY",Male
His staff was very good and courteous when I arrived and made me feel at ease. Dr. Xavier was excellent and I was very impressed with him. He is extremely nice and seems very caring. Took care of my problem. Will highly recommend to friends/family.,Male
"Dr. Xavier was recommended by by PCP a few years ago. Best recommendation he could have made! Dr. Xavier is very thorough and takes the time to address what’s happening in your body with the goal of finding and resolving the problem, not the symptoms. That’s very important to me. He has a good bedside manner and his staff is very efficient.",Male
I would recommend dr.xavier to anybody he is the best he took care of my husband for about 6yrs.and they both also got along great my husband ramon.from chandler az.really appreciated him for all that he did for him.so thank you dr.xavier for all that you did for my husband .see you later,Male
"Dr Xavier is caring for my 96 year old mother, and is an excellent physician.  The explanations are easy to understand and he is proactive in her care.  He is trustworthy and kind.",Male
"Saw Dr. Xavier today for the first time. He was polite, understanding, and seem genuinely interested in accurately diagnosing my issue.",Male
"I have been Dr. Xavier's patient for about ten years and I have found him to be a wonderful doctor in many ways.  He always takes time to really listen and respond to any questions or concerns,  He always asks questions to find out about any changes or new problems.  I always leave feeling like he is on top of all my health issues.  He is able to schedule most procedures right. in his office.  His staff is always friendly and efficient.  I am very grateful to be one of his patients.",Male
"Dr. Xavier has been my cardiologist for over 10 years. He saw me through my first MI and double by-pass, and through a subsequent heart attack and stent. He's seen me through three jobs and four changes in insurance. I have seen him through two other institutions and I'm glad he has now established his own. During all of this time he has shown himself to be caring and courteous. I have noticed the deference he receives at the hospital. He is respected among them. My PCP recommends him.",Male
Dr. XAVIER has been treating my husband for many years. His skills are excellent and his patient manner is caring and kind. His office staff is on time and professional as well as friendly. ,Male
Caring seems to personally want to make sure you are in good health,Male
"I have been Dr. Xavier's patient since Jan 2006, after double heart bypass surgery at CRH.  I got a stent for a 3rd blockage as my veins would not support a third bypass.  Dr. Xavier is very diligent about following up with regular tests to ensure my heart remains in good condition.  He reviews my medications at each appointment--two or three times a year--to ensure they are needed and are the best meds for me.  He gives me the time I need at each appointment and listens to my issues.",Male
Front desk staff and medical assistant were very present and comforting but the Dr and management were horrible.  I'm a new patient to this office and will never be back. The Dr rushes through the visit and was over booked so the manager also a nurse talked to me prior to the appointment  and then the Dr came in and rushed through the visit.  I felt like they didn't take the time to listen and when they billed my insurance I received a statement showing I owed for the entire visit. Horrible ,Male
Poor bedside manner. Very rude and obnoxious towards staff including nurses. ,Male
"Excellent bedside manner, easy to talk to and provides excellent information to the patient",Male
Dr. Xavier saw my Dad who was in his late 70's. He was very blessed to have her at his bedside making life/death decisions with him regarding treatment. She has a gift in dealing with the stubborn patient/family members! All joking aside I was scared and wanted to have her proposed treatment plan looked at by a second opinion.  Doctor at USC told me to run back to her and start the treatment right away! She knew what was best and I am proud to refer her. My Dad is happy &amp;thriving in his 80's now,Female
"Dr. Xavier saved my life! I will ALWAYS LOVE AND RESPECT HER!!! THANK YOU DR. XAIVER
",Female
If I could leave zero stars I would. The facility is not clean. I waited 2 hours for Dr. Xavier to see my newborn. He glanced at my son and sat on his computer for 15 min. Received a phone call a week later asking if my son had been seen by them because no one was doing there job. Was also informed of diagnosis that should have been mentioned during his first apt. Horrible doctor! Horrible facility!,Male
Going on a 3 hour wait just to get a pregnancy prevetion shot.....,Male
Don't even bother. If you call asking if they do certain procedures or if you need to keep searching you'll just get berated by someone who I assume was the doctor after the receptionist passed the phone to him. Not every office provides surgical options and clearly asking about them makes this doctor feel defensive. He constantly spoke over me when I attempted to ask questions and hung up on me when I tried to explain that I was just calling to get information.,Male
"Very well done.  Great service, convenient location, very good timing.
Highly recommend.

Alexander M.",Male
The office was very clean the receptionist was very friendly and the office staff was very informative and very pleasant to be around,Male

very good doctor and monica excellent workers thank you so much for helping me with my pain,Male
"I visited Dr.Xavier for pain in my neck.  I found everyone so pleasant and nice. They make you feel like you've been friends for years. Dr. Xavier was very nice, made everything so clear and easy to understand. I felt so comfortable, the procedure was over before I knew it. Would definitely recommend them.",Male
"Dr. Xavier is very personable and was able to alleviate my pain! Just as importantly, the process of getting an appointment and checking in was flawless. I  also truly appreciate the kindness of his staff!",Male
Good dr very professionally and Secretary really nice very good,Male
He was great with his treatment if my injuries. Wished I found him sooner.,Male
"My visits with Dr. Xavier were very satisfying. He was very clear in letting me know about my injury, treatment and what to expect. Dr. Xavier helped me so much with my pain. He knows exactly what he is doing and with his expertise was able to alleviate my pain. He also took extra time with me to explain what was going on with my injury and how he could help my pain. I would highly recommend Dr. Xavier for anybody suffering pain in their spine area. I am living now pain-free thanks to him.",Male
"I saw Dr Xavier about a week ago for injections for my neck and back. It was painless and quick and Dr Xavier took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly prior to starting. He answered all of my questions and put any concerns I had at ease. I highly recommend Dr Xavier and in regards to the injections, I found instant relief immediately following my visit.",Male
"I went to see Dr.Xavier.Clean office,elaborate patient care and best outcome.I give him a 5 Star.",Male
"Dr. Xavier takes the time with you before any procedure.  I started with injections and ended up going on and doing their heat therapy treatment and it was such a relief to actually have my pain gone and what he did is for chronic pain so it lasts permanently if you don't aggravate it in the future.  So far it's been 7 months since I had the procedure done and I would recommend this doctor to my family and friends.  My grandfather actually did the RFA too, he said he wish he done it sooner.",Male
"If you've done any of these procedures before and just wanna get in and get out, this is the place for you. But if it's your first time and you're concerned about someone doing a epidural steroid shot in your cervical (neck) region and you're very anxious? NOT the place to go. He was rushing me through my question and it's not like I was beating around the bush. I came in with clear, to the point questions and he couldn't say or do anything to reassure me that I'll be ok or even what to expect. ",Male
Is very qualified. Takes the time necessary to listen to my concerns.  She gave very helpful input regarding cataract surgery on my one good eye which had a high risk of retina detachment.  Took the time to go through all of the benefits and risks.,Female
She is so good that she identified another health issue that my PCP had not identified.,Female

"Dr Xavier is a very nice, compassionate and knowledgeable Doctor.  She is a retna specialist.  She will help you correct and maintain your vision.  She takes time to explain things and is a pleasant person to be around.",Female
Florida Eye Clinic was a wonderful experience.  The staff and Dr.Xavier went above and beyond to help me when I had my eye surgery.  Great practice!!!,Female
"I have been seeing Dr. Xavier for going on 3 years and have never left an appointment feeling misunderstood. As a psychiatrist, Dr. Xavier is attentive, insightful, and warm-hearted. I respect and admire her deeply.",Female

"My daughter was seeing this dr for couple of months paying $350 each time until we found an in-network physician and made an appointment. A week prior to that appointment my daughter ran out of her Prozac and called for a refill.  Dr Xavier denied the prescription. Since the new doctor still hasn’t seen my daughter she couldn’t prescribe. Without meds my daughter risks a withdrawal and worsening of her depression. This is malpractice, patient abandonment before new treatment plan is established.",Female
Super helpful!  Dr Xavier took extra time to listen to our needs and help us in the best way she could. Knowledgeable and completely recommended!,Female
"My husband and I met with Dr. Xavier for an initial consultation on behalf of our daughter, who has several previously diagnosed conditions. In addition to not having read the extensive background histories I filled out through the Patient Portal prior to our appointment, Dr. Xavier was brusque and condescending in person. Our 45-minute, $350 session was not nearly enough time to give Dr. Xavier a thorough clinical picture of our daughter. We were sorely disappointed with this physician.",Female
I look forward to my appointments. She is knowledgeable and compassionate. I have seen many other mental health professionals before but no one compares.,Female
Dr. Xeller is brilliant.  Best ortho surgeon ever! Highly recommended.,Male
"I would seriously warn anyone against seeking medical treatment from Charles F. Xeller. He treated both my father &amp; myself with an amazing lack of empathy &amp; an amazing lack of sufficient pain medication. I have nightmares to this day, 20 years after having a frozen shoulder broken free. My BP shot up out of fear but he disregarded it. Only after I consulted another orthopedist who performed 2 other procedures did I learn my shoulder could have been released painlessly, &amp; prescribed a proper regimen of follow-up therapy, which Xeller did not. I reported him to the American Medical Association which, of course, did nothing because no doctor will stand against another. Today the shoulder is stronger than the other.  I suspect the second orthopedist found bone chips left from the first treatment, but he said nothing.  I cannot stress this enough.  AVOID CHARLES F. XELLER'S TREATMENTS AT ALL COSTS.",Male
Was a patient for over 20 years.  She suddenly decides she is closing her office and because of a coding mistake SHE made in bloodwork and she won’t even call to labcorp to make it right.  So I am stuck with a $239 bill,Female
love love love  she treats the whole person not just the thyroid,Female
She is wonderful and cares the most for her patients.  She will spend extensive time with her patients.  I have utmost respect for her.,Female
worst office to be in if you expect to be seen at your scheduled time office staff is clueless and doctor receives payment that should go to the patient but the doctor feels entitled to keep it for herself be advised to check your statements shes probably ripping you off too. lousy experience ,Female
"The office is run poorly... wait time can be up to 5 hours.... there is no privacy, receptionist plays voicemails on speaker where everyone in waiting room can hear, she also has phone conversations on speaker with patients, no privacy.... if you try to leave message on voicemail, it’s full....",Female
Best diagnostician and endocrinologist ! She saved my life. She also discovered a disease in my wife that many other doctors had missed.,Female
Dr xenachis is an amazing doctor. She is the sweetest lady however it is a long wait time in the office. Mostly because she spends a lot of time which each patient which is good. If you have time to wait a bit then I highly recommend her. No one could control my symptoms but after a few dose adjustments of my meds I feel great. She also tries to help you as much as she can and remembers all her patients ,Female
"It was highly recommended for me to see this Dr but was warned of the difficulty in making an appointment. I was put on hold 3 times for over five minutes each time then disconnected. I was never asked my name and number so she could call me back at a better time.. which by the way, is the way a professional office operates. I wonder if the Dr. knows that the people who work for her represent the practice in this manner.",Female
"The office is a disgrace. My daughter recently had a 1:30 pm appointment, and wasn't seen until almost 5:00 pm. She was then left in the exam room for another 40 minutes. She finally got out of there at about 6:15. No apologies came from anyone. If it hadn't taken 6 months to get this appointment, she would have run out of there. Such a complete disregard for people. NEVER AGAIN.",Female
"he spends an inordinate amount of time with each patient and engenders great confidence in her talent and abilities. She is an excellent diagnostician and works with knowledge and professionalism.

"running greater than 45 minutes late. Front desk staff very short in answers and do not go above and beyond for customer service. Had to use vacation time and did not get seen. When asked for a letter to verify time there, I was told they don't think they can do that. I had to ask them to look into it.
Not satisfied due to the lack of concern and service.",Male
"I have never waited more than 5 minutes to be seen. Dr. Xenias will answer any questions and when he discovered a malignant melanoma, it was immediately removed. I have recommended him to friends and family and everyone continues to see him. It is worth the wait to get a first appointment.",Male
He was professional and great sense of humor. Delivered my grand daughter and was such a breathe of fresh air how he guided our daughter during her having difficulty to push. I would recommend his to everyone.,Male
Spent time reviewing my history and offered suggestions for issues I’ve been dealing with other docs even though I was seeing him for unrelated problems. Very thorough and professional. Easy to talk to and understand. Good sense of humor eased the visit. ,Male
"Easy to talk to, explains every option available, and spends time with each patient. ",Male
"Doctor Xenophon is one of the best physicians I have ever been to. He really cares for his patients. He takes as much time as necessary to make sure that you know what you need to know. He explains things in understandable terms. He listens to your complaints and really takes them into consideration when planning your care. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a caring, intelligent, and down to earth practitioner. ",Male
"He is currently the back up dr for my wife as she goes through her pregnancy, and he is by far the worst ob we have ever worked with. He is rude, condescending, brief, holier-than-thou, his word goes and it doesnt matter what his colleagues have to say. We absolutly can not stand this man. He has pretty much dont absolutly nothing for us. He belittles everything his colleagues have to say. I dont trust him. Or anything he has to say. I very highly do not recomend him. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!",Male
"Dr. Xenophon is personable and knowledgeable. He listens to you as a patient; he offers his best advice but listens to what you want, as well. He is respectful, humorous, and skilled at his surgical techniques.",Male
I found him extremely rude but was able to look past that until he miss diagnosed me. To say I was furious is an understatement. I would not not trust him to treat my worse enemy.,Male
"He saved my father's leg from amputation. Grateful for Dr. Xenophontos expertise. My father
likes how he explained everything in terms he understood. ",Male

"He has saved my husband’s life twice. Several friends in the medical field highly recommended Dr. X for my husband, and we are forever thankful! He is VERY patient oriented, kind, extremely knowledgeable and skilled. When we have had a longer wait than we would like, we know it is because he is likely saving someone else’s life.  He is the best!!",Male
 You will enjoy his thoroughness and concern for your medical problems other than just his specialty.  Wish he did more than just cardiology I could sure use a neurologist as concerned for my health as he. ,Male
I have seen Dr Xenopoulos once a year at the Decatur office. He seems to be very professional with a very quiet sense of humor. The Decatur office seems to be over-scheduled as I often wait over an hour to see him.,Male
"Dr. Xenopoulos care saved my physical and mental well-being more than once. His rapid assessment, diagnosis and careplan resolved my issues. His mannerisms were gentle, his direction firm, and his caring mannerisms a necessity.  He helped calm me and directed my care with precision.",Male
"We met Dr Xenopoulos when my father had a heart attack and was flown from a small hospital in Jellico to Park West. He was wonderful to my Dad and to our family. Very, very calm and reassuring. Daddy is alive now because of him. The follow-up care in his office was great too. ",Male
"After falling through the cracks with another cardiologist, I switched over to Dr. Xenopoulos and I've been extremely impressed with him. He's excellent technically as well as interpersonally, based on my experience having a heart cath performed by him and several appointments surrounding my resulting heart surgery. I recommend him without reservation. He's compassionate, caring and after putting my life into his hands, I can honestly say he's the best in town. ",Male
"Caring, considerate, but not a pill pusher, Dr. Xenon treats you with respect and professional courtesy. ",Female
He was very helpful listened to my concerns and gave me the help I need. ,Male

He explained everything thoroughly and made sure I understood before I left the office. I would recommend him to anyone, and everyone to Dr. Xenos",Male
"My father was supposed to meet with a VA doctor here.  There was confusion as this doctor my father did not recognize and no one knew anything about the visit.  After all was said and done, my father keeps receiving a bill from this doctor he wasn't even scheduled to see! (And he wasn't very personable as well.) This guy didn't do anything, but will sure bill you anyway!",Male
Dr. Eleni has been my PCP for 3 years. She provides unparalleled care and demonstrates the utmost compassion toward her patients.  She’s truly an amazing physician.,Female
Dr. Xenos has been my pcp for several years now and I couldn't imagine seeing another doctor! She's very kind and incredibly easy to talk to. 100% would recommend to anyone looking for a primary care.,Female
"My experience with Dr. Xenos over about 2-3 yrs was that she delivered poor medical care. She repeatedly had me make appointments for silly things, ordered blood work, and referred me to specialists for things that she could have handled. Conversely, she would not do simple care such as pap smears or signing a medical waiver so that I could go on a hiking trip. I am in excellent health and should only have to see a doctor a couple times a year for routine checkups and this was ridiculous.",Female
"I love Dr Xenos! She is patient, kind, and offers a very realistic approach to health.  She doesn't over prescribe or jump to conclusions, which I really like.
The PA who works here is good too.",Female
"During my surgery (02/20/2020), my ‘tray was contaminated’, Dr. Xenos put me on very strong antibiotics which caused me to vomit for several days. He was not happy with my progress at my first appt. (He is extremely disrespectful of the patients time. I waited more than one hour past my appt time.) After this I worked very hard and made up the lost ground but by April I was still not sure of my progress so we decided in favor of a manipulation. After the procedure I began to experience nerve pain so when I saw him at my next visit I couldn’t yet say I was “glad I did it”. At this point his treatment of me shifted. He said “You have a good result. You just can’t be happy. You probably should not have done it.” I received no further support from  the Dr. It’s now been a year and I can say that I would NOT recommend Dr. Xenos. I now believe that something happened to the nerve during surgery. I know plenty of people who have no pain at the one year mark and that is not my story.",Male
"My visits and surgery with Dr xenos was fabulous. I felt very comfortable with my knee replacement. It was seamless. He was thorough, explained the procedure and prepared me well. I had quick recovery &amp; HIGHLY recommend him. I will be using him for my 2nd knee when the time comes.",Male
"I had both knees replaced 12 weeks apart. Couldn't ask for a better experience. Before during and after, Dr Xenos, his staff and skyridge hospital made me feel like a priority, truly cared for and treated with skill and compassion. Dr Xenos is an amazing surgeon as well as a very kind man. He's attentive, encouraging and takes his time to educate and make you feel comfortable and knowledgeable about your condition and surgery. He's my favorite doctor and I'm so grateful I chose him to give me my new knees. I never imagined I could really be without pain and able to do so many things again. It's a long awaited reality that I owe to Dr. Xenos. I saw other doctors and read so many reviews, but when I met him I knew that he was the right one. I write this review for others who are trying to make a good choice for their knee replacement surgery. It's a big decision not to take lightly. Good luck!",Male
"I can't praise Doctor Xenos enough. He and his staff are awesome. I've seen the top 10 ortho docs in Metro area and had 2 TKR and a revision. 2 surgeries were painfully unsuccessful and Doctor Xenos was the first to see what the problem was, come up with a course of action and perform a successful TKR. His and his staff's concern and attention has been amazing. I wish I had found him in the first place and recommend him highly for your hip and knee issues.",Male
"DON’T USE DR XENOS!!!  We were treated by Dr Xenos over a period of almost two years.  Over this time, he performed two shoulder surgeries, many office visits and prescribed countless rehab sessions.  Dr Xenos also had us take several MRI’s, x-rays, EMG, and other tests that not only very expensive, but turned out unnecessary.  After two years of treatment, we are no better off than when we started.  We finally decided to find a different doctor and have yet have a third surgery to finally fix my shoulder.  My new doctor has admitted that Dr Xenos did a very poor job on my shoulder and he didn’t understand why.  This all started in mid-2018 with an initial surgery to fix frozen shoulder, bicep tendon, and some impingement.  After the first surgery Dr Xenos admitted that he probably should have done more and that we might have to come in for a second surgery.  This was told to my husband directly after surgery to our surprise.  Why not just take care of everything while he was performin",Male
"He examined me for approx. 16 min. determined all my issues were degenerative and I was fine. He does IME examinations for insurance companies, is paid very well for writing reports in favor of the insurance company. Very well !",Male
Dr Xenos performed my hip replacement surgery about 5 years ago.  Never have I been treated so kindly and the surgery was a 100% success.  He is a wonderful surgeon and a great person.,Male
"Dr Xenos did a total hip replacement last week of Dec 2018..  I am 13 weeks out and would tell anyone that needs this procedure to call Dr Xenos right away. He explains everything, he kind, compassionate and really cares about YOU! I am pain free and able to walk and hike without pain for the first time in 15 yrs.",Male
Dr Xenos is awesome! He is straight forward and tells you how it is. Gives you your options with a clear understanding of the risk's. He is truly concerned for the patient. Always ready to answer any question you may have. I would recommend Dr Xenos to all my friends and Family. ,Male
Dr Xenos is absolutely fantastic! My wife had bilateral knee replacement about 5yrs ago - not ONE problem! I had him do my ACL replacement August 8 ‘18 and would have absolutely NO problem with “going in blind” and telling Dr Xenos to do whatever he needs to do and tell me about it later! I have absolute faith in him and his staff! We drive 400 miles round trip to see him. My Physical Therapist said “there are a lot of painters between here and there but Dr Xenos is an artist! I agree!!,Male
"If you expect kind, helpful staff, respectful service, reasonable wait times, or a concerned surgeon go elsewhere. I was sorely disappointed with my experience with Dr. Xenos over the course of three months. I cancelled surgery with him because I honestly believe he would not take my well being into consideration based on how he runs his greedy and arrogant practice. ",Male
"Dr. Xenos and his staff are phenomenal. I had a right total hip replacement 4 months ago. He was so kind, compassionate, explained everything in a way I could understand. I trust him 100%.  The day of surgery he did everything he could to make me feel at ease. After surgery, he was right there making sure I was ok. I had such a wonderful experience with Dr. Xenos. I highly recommend him!",Male
My first introduction came to Dr. Xenos after I had broken my leg skiing.  He was able to get me into surgery 2 days after the accident.  The special accomodation that the office staff gave me at each visit was nothing short of good old fashioned customer service.  The care and concern that Dr. Xenos demonstrated was very comforting and sincere.  I would recommend him to anyone.,Male
"Dr. Xenos is my daughters surgeon. He has repaired her hip for Labral tear, twice with great success. 
He has an excellent and patient demeanor. He is highly recommended. You may have to wait to get in to see him, as well as when you do get an appointment...it is not unusual to wait an hour or more. Good thing there is a coffee machine and good reading material in the waiting room.",Male
I have had 2 total knee replacements with Dr Xenos.  He is those most meticulous dr and extremely compassionate.,Male
"I had a total knee replacement performed by Dr. Xenos nearly two years ago (Feb 2015).  I was at first apprehensive of undergoing the surgery, however Dr. Xenos and staff did an very good job making me feel comfortable with the procedure by explaining the surgery, recovery and risks.  My total experience surrounding my knee replacement was excellent.  I cannot say there was anything that could have made my surgical experience and care any better.  I say the same for Sky Ridge Medical Center.",Male
"Long history of joint issues, especially, but not limited to shoulder damage &amp; arthritis, eventually leading to various orthopaedic &amp; neuro surgeries, including bi-lateral shoulder replacements.
Dr. Xenos is not only a superior physician and surgeon IMO, but also one of the best &amp; most caring individuals I've ever met. AND he's got the best sense of humor to boot.
I can't Thank him enough for all the care he's provided for me that's kept me mobile.",Male
Very knowledgeable with an awesome bedside manner. Dr X got  her back to full strength and range of motion. ,Male

I would recommend Dr X to my family and friends ,Male
"Absolutely, he was very so nice and easy to talk to (just as Dr Refai has always been, he referred me) and ask questions. A lot of DR’s you can’t do that, they won’t give you the time and trust me I know I have a 24 year old severely disabled daughter and we lived at CHOA for many years in and out... so it was nice.",Male
"Dr. X is the best of the best. Very direct, forthcoming, and precise about what we needed to do regarding my torn meniscus. Surgery was as good of an experience as surgery can be, and I have been able to tell from the get-go that Dr. X cares about my health and outcome.",Male
Great Knee Orthopedic Surgeon. He took time to explain my diagnosis and the surgery needed. Post op care and communication was great. ,Male

"Dr. Xia has been a Godsend in treating my dad's cancer. She is truly caring and fights for him to have a good quality of life. I wish I could say the same for the other doctors involved in his care. She has helped to corral them into action to help get solutions and him feeling better. She has spent time with him and with us - listening, asking questions, and figuring out the best course of action. We are grateful. ",Female
"Our family transferred a relative from PA to OH. We found Dr. Xia here in Toledo and visited Dr. Xia's office at Flower Hospital and met her and her staff. They were all very helpful, kind, and understanding of our circumstances.  Dr. Xia was excellent at explaining our relative's condition, prognosis, and treatment plan. She put our family at ease by being forthright in what to expect. Her practice was instrumental in transferring all pertinent medical information. Thank you Dr. Xia and staff.",Female
"Dr Xia treated my dad for cancer.  She was the most compassionate physician I have ever had the opportunity to get to know.  In addition, she was extremely knowledgeable and fought for the best cancer treatment for my dad, including immunotherapy.  She was straightforward about treatment outcomes and remained positive throughout the process without providing false hopes.  She was always in the know of my dad's current status and welcomed communication if his condition changed.  ",Female
"Dr. Xia has always been willing to spend whatever amount of time I need.  She allows me the time to ask any questions I have and does her absolute best to respond  in a way that I understand what she's trying to explain.  I trust her fully and hope she stays for many years.  Unlike many other physicians today, Dr. Xia is personable and has my best interest at heart. Recently, she called me at home to follow up on a visit.  Try getting that personalized service from another physician.",Female
"I can't speak for others but I can certainly speak for myself.  And now I will tell the tell.  As a patient of conscience and a patient of Dr. Xia, I always sought guidance over misdirection, professional input over interference, persistent courage over relentless fear, truthful diagnosis and treatments over false hope and fevered pipe dreams, compassion over indifference, and the will to keep fighting over surrendering.  Dr. Xia has always given me the positive attributes I just mentioned.  She will forever be my lighthouse beacon when facing and weathering storms.",Female
"I am receiving excellent care from Dr. Xia. She referred me for all diagnostic tests possible to get a complete picture of my specific cancer and she thoroughly explained my treatment options to help me make an informed decision. I have the utmost trust in her recommendations and management of my care. Dr. Xia is keeping a careful watch on my treatment progress and is alert to any possible issues.

I am especially appreciative of her compassion and her attention to detail. ",Female
Dr. Xia is an excellent doctor she has taken care of me for years and she is a hematologist.,Female
"She's just a big NO! for me. She was to focus on sending me back to my old Oncologist because she felt like he is a great doctor. Then, she kept saying why did I travel 2 hours to see an Oncologist. To make matters worst, her office called me to schedule a mammogram when I have no breasts... Am I a patient or another paycheck?",Female
"I have been impressed on multiple visits by Dr. Xia's holistic view.  He somehow seems to know what questions to ask that bring to surface areas I am overlooking which are key to getting me back and focused.  I have noticed much improvement in my MDD since having him take over my care.  He appears to have a genuine care for my wellbeing, not just in prescribing medication. My best psychiatrist, by far!",Male

Amazing miracle! Highly recommended! Anxiety.",Male
"Dr Xia has saved my life! I have suffered years of anxiety and depression and any medication never really ""fixed"" my issues.  I am at the end of my dTMS treatment and am amazed at the results this far.  I find so much enjoyment again in activities, socializing, and life.  My relationship with my partner has been better now than ever before, and my partner attributes it to the ""new me.""  I am very grateful for having Dr Xia, and I highly recommend him!!",Male

"Dr. Xia is friendly, courteous, smart, reassuring.  A great physician.",Female
I wouldn't even consider going to another doctor for the areas she's so well versed and proficient in!!,Female
Very negative. He does not actually care for the welfare of others. Only looking to make money.,Male
"Dr. Tian Xia has been a God Send and a blessing. I have trusted his Medical expertise for over 20 yrs. The first time I meet Dr. Xia, I was experiencing tremendous lower back. Dr.Xia expressed he don't perfrom blind medicine. He listen to his patient symptoms,  search for the diagnosis, inform patient of finding and suggested treatment. 
His diagnose has always been accurate, even if the only resolution required surgery he has always been truthful. Dr. Xia next to my primary is my first person I see when pain is involved. What I trust, and love  trust most about Dr. Xia is he passionate, personalable, and experienced, he is also a team player.

"Dr. Xia defines the highest quality of patient care. Professional, knowledgable, and personable.  In my opinion, Dr. Xia is one of the finest MDs available.",Male
"Best experience I've had with a dermatologist in 16 years of needing skin cancer care.  Dr. Xia is considerate and caring to a patient's needs.   He performed a long, complicated MOHS surgery on my forehead.  I was not new to MOHS, this was my third.  The first was performed by a surgeon in another city and nothing about that experience left me willing to be proactive about my dermatology care.  My follow-up appointments with Dr. Xia by comparison have been pleasant and helpful, which makes me a more compliant patient.  As his patient,  I felt listened to because he shows genuine concern for what you're asking or feeling unsure about.  I'm very thankful to have had Dr. Xia as my surgeon and my follow-up dermatologist.",Male
"Awful doctor, takes forever , sends in students in her place. During my diagnoses she started scaring me with all kinds of things. I never leave her appointment feeling like things are being figured out or okay. ",Female

"Dr. Xian has been my neurologist for three years now and I would highly recommend him. He is very professional and courteous, and he is incredibly knowledgeable. I definitely put my faith in him when it comes to treating my migraines!",Male
"I love Dr. Xian, he takes the time to talk to you and explain procedures and results. When I went to him in 2011 asking for a baseline MRI for Essential Tremors, I expected to get a hard time, but he was very understanding and cooperative. In 2017 he saved my life by suggesting another MRI since the 2011 was so long ago. By doing this he discovered an brain aneurysm which I was able to get treatment for and now has disapeared.",Male
"Dr. X is extremely rude, dismissive, and has no compassion. His botox treatment was not successful for me, so he became angry and said ""you have brain damage that's why it's not helping, get a new MRI"" I haven't had another tumor in 20 years but it's the only answer he had. Horrible to make a patient feel this way, to scare me, and leave me feeling hopeless because his ego was brought down. Nobody deserves that. He needs to learn bedside manner, compassion and professionalism.",Male
"Dr Xiang is really good. He takes time with you, gives you appropriate tests, and is decisive in his conclusions. He is smart and listens carefully. Truly an outstanding doctor. He has helped me greatly for a year and a half.  I strongly recommend him.

"I had seen Dr. Xiao at USC Keck School of medicine for 3 years previously. She had the brain of a surgeon, &amp; the heart of a therapist. She deserves all the 5 star ratings cited.",Female
I saw Dr Xiao in ER and he was a very pleasant man. He made me feel very comfortable and seemed very knowledgeable with his diagnoses. He even took the time to call me at home to make sure I was doing ok two days later. Almost no doctors will do that anymore.  That shows he cares!!!,Male
shes nasty does not listen very very rude,Female
"I seen Dr. Xiao for a yearly exam.  She is very friendly, and seems like a neighbor next door! She is very caring and compassionate about her patients. I highly recommend her for your physician!

Excellent Dr. highly recommended ,Female
She and her staff is the best !!,Female
"I am new to Texas and had to choose a new PCP and I chose Dr. Xiao and was very disappointed. I am 45 years old and know my health and history very well. She did not listen to me and wanted to change my meds and did so. When I called back to ask her to change my meds back, she wanted me to come in for an office visit...just for that. Mind you, these are not new meds to me so I know what I need. I only saw her 2 times and will never see her again or recommend her to anyone I know &amp; love.",Female
"Very greedy and unprofessional!
I made an appointment to see Dr Xiao for a routine checkup, the visit should be covered by the insurance company 100%. They wanted me to pay $50 just to read my mammogram report. I ended up leaving the office without seeing the doctor. AVOID this doctors’ office. They only care about money, not the patients’ health. They better not charge my insurance company for the service they’ve never performed!!!",Female
"Dr. Xiao's staff is unprofessional and does not know how to address patient's concerns. I would call their office and they would hang up on me multiple times just because they don't want to answer my questions and help me. 

Even when I go into the office, they would say they don't know and to come back another day or call another day. ",Female
"???? ,  ???????,?????????????",Female
"I work as a physician assistant at hospital so I know what a patient should be treated professionally. I will NEVER recommend this doctor. Wait time is 2.5 hours.  Front desk people ask for wrong copay without checking insurance, provider spend 5 min talking to me. The worst part is she only spend 10 seconds on breast and pelvic exam. My Priamry Doctor felt a breast tumor but she could not !! Patients are treated carelessly  and unprofessional !!",Female
"very bad ,never visit again",Female
"Big mistake, the wait time Avg 2.5 hours for a rushed 5 mins consultation, messed up patient reports, horrible front desk. Good luck you are in your own hands!",Female
The wait time is ridiculous. I waited almost 4 hours after my appointment time. Please respect patient's time when scheduling appointment.,Female
I just needed a vaccine shot and I had to wait 1 hour. I saw the doctor just sitting in her room and chatting with another nurse. This place is terrible.,Female
"Do you want to wait 3 HOURS PAST YOUR APPOINTMENT TIME TO SEE THE DOCTOR? If you do, then this is the perfect spot for you. My appointment was at 12:00pm, it's currently 3:00pm and I still haven't been called.",Female
I used this office no othee than out of convenience which was a wrong choice for slecting a doctor.   Having been a patient with her for the past few years &amp; each time was a disappointment.   From the front desk receptionist to the doctor herself.   All of the staff were very unprofessional to said the least and the doctor herself.   Making appontment was pointless.   They made you waited for over an hour for the exam that's no more than 3 mins.  They made you to paid for what insurance covered,Female
"Terrible!   Waited 2 hours, I didn't even see doctor",Female
"Very unprofessional office. I have company insurance that many providers accept.  Anyway, the nurse or assistant told me that the package for Annual check requires an additional $160 because my insurance only covers basic checks.  After I told her to just do whatever the insurance covers, she asked me whether I have any questions to the doctor.  If I do, then I need to pay the $40 copay.  She also told me my insurance don't pay well.",Female
"I've been with Dr. Xiao's office for over 5 years since she started at her first location on Kissena Blvd. She is nice, knowledgeable, patient, and gentle. She has expanded to another office and has employed other MDs to see her patients. I'm glad for her but making an appt here is POINTLESS and it is a complete DISRESPECT to her patients when you are made to wait for over THREE hours to be seen and finally leave. There's no explanation good enough for the front desk to give! 7 out of 10 TIMES!",Female
"Terrible experience with the service. Do not treat patients as humans. The front desk tried to charge me $600 for my HPV vaccine which is clearly covered by my insurance. After making sure with my insurance company, I called the front desk again to tell them that the shots are in fact covered. The front desk replied in the most nasty way  you still have to pay if you come take the shot, or we won't administer anything I am definitely changing my doctor.",Female
"Busy dr. As I was asking questions, she was getting ready to leave the room. I was planning to get pregnant by then, and hoped I could get some suggestions. I ask few questions. She answered w/ yes or no. No explanation. Later she asked me if I was on folic acid, which I said yes. And that was it. Later I went online and read about the cautions I need to take when becoming pregnant.I realize they didn't even ask me if I have a cat, (and I do) and if I need a test for toxoplasmosis!",Female
Very professional and accurate. Would recommend. ,Female
the best experience.  highly  recommend.  ,Female
"Gave us the run around. She said my son needed a colonoscopy but no orders were put in at mngastro. When pressed to request the order she stated we had to come back in. Why? My son was in extreme pain for 6 weeks. Went to urgent care who also agreed for the need for an urgent colonoscopy. The PA couldn't put the order in, it needed to come from Dr. Xiao. Again, Dr. Xaio said we would need to make an appointment to be seen before she would out in an urgent request.",Female
"Dr Kanyan Xiao is kind, professional, and complete in evaluating and diagnosing issues.  She was quick to get a good oncologist on the case, when my late husband had suddenly developed colon cancer in 2018.  After his death, I selected Dr. Xiao as my PCP.  She is helping me manage and control the heart  issues I've developed and also is monitoring and managing my stress related weight gain and sleep apnea concerns.  Everyone I've encountered in Dr. Xiao's office is kind, caring, and always professionally sharp and aware.  I highly recommend Dr. Xiao and the Perimeter North Family Medicine Team!",Female
"Dr. Xiao is excellent. She is absolutely the best PCP I have ever had. Coming from a Nurse that is high praise. She just called me back after leaving a message a few hours ago. We talked about the issues I am dealing with. I love her.

er.",Female
"During a very critical time in my life, Dr. Xiao took the time to listen to me and help me navigate my way back to good health.  In addition to prescribing the right medicine she also gave me a hug to reassure me that I would be fine.  That is rare! This Doctor is AMAZING to say the least! So glad I found her!
",Female
"Kanyan Xiao refused to help me when I showed up for my appointment. She was extremely rude and basically lectured me the entire time about the medication I use. I was diagnosed and prescribed this medication 6 years ago. She made me feel I was abusing the drug. I walked out of that office tearing up and shaking. Since she wouldn't help me, I had to make another appointment with a different doctor. This was my first and last time ever making an appointment with her.",Female
"Dr. Xiao is such a good doctor! She is very thorough.  She has navigated me through several concurrent health issues, each progressive.  I feel like I am always listened to.  She saved my husband from a serious blood infection that the orthopedic doctor totally missed.  Had it not been for her, my husband may have been hospitalized.  Her staff is always friendly and as helpful as her.  In addition, getting an appointment is very simple.  She's a caring, kind and brilliant doctor.  ",Female
"Dr. Xiao listens to her patient, explains her findings, and quick to respond to needs, something sadly lacking by other physicians I have encountered.  Would recommend her highly to anyone needing a really good Primary Care Physician.",Female
Very satisfied with Dr. Xiao. ,Female

Always answered my phone calls, effective and efficient to arrange 4 medical care &amp; interpretation services during my stay @ MY Methodist Hospital. I recommended Dr. Xiao to my wife, my daughter and my son-in-law. My senior center friends and my daughter's doctor recommended Dr. Xiao to me in the first place. Very grateful towards Dr. Xiao!!!",Male
Do not go to this practice. You are just a number to this Doctor. She does not care for the patients and has no regard for your well being. They do procedures just to bill insurance and make more money.,Female
"All the front desk and nurses in the office speak limited English. So expect to repeat yourself a lot and explain what you mean or just get a blank stare and a nod and be totally dismissed or asked to sit and wait to see doc. Doc hardly examined me and only touched me when I ask if she needed to take a look. She was busy writing down the notes, which is old school. Electronic medical records is a mandate. Doctor was desperate to get done with me and move on the next patient. Do not recommend!!!",Female
"What a rip off.  I went in to talk about my celiac disease and ended getting an unnecessary colonoscopy.  I also got charge for a biopsy that didn't happen, because I had no polyps.  Then I got charged twice for something I didn't need in the first place.  Twice!   I write f* off on the checks I send them.  They might get completely paid off in a couple of years.",Male
do not go to this guy. he tore my spleen. I ended up in intensive care for 3 days. he did not hold himself  responsible for any of it. do not go to this guy,Male
"Actually I want to give a zero star for this pathetic example of a Dr. His office put my husband through the worst pain and torture to prep for the colonoscopy while under severe rectal pain!!!  He laid and screamed for 17 hours while going through the many bowel movements he had to go through during his “GENTLE” prep plan.  He does the colonoscopy.  Then let’s me know his colonoscopy was clean!!  WHAT!  Impossible!  For 4 months my husband has suffered this pain!!! I ask him what else could be the problem and he said, “I DONT KNOW!  He said he has lot of anxiety.  He need to relax when he goes to the bathroom!!!!! WHAT?  He had a CT SCAN two days later and they found he has a RECTAL ABSCESS!  4 months he has lived with this and a SIMPLE CT Scan was all he needed to give us an answer!  This Dr. should no longer be in practice!",Male
"Had severe abdominal pain.  Performed Colonoscopy.   Said lots of inflammation. Biopsied multiple areas. Went back for results. Said everything perfect on colonoscopy. Colon looked great. Asked why I'm in severe pain? Said he didn't know. Told him  Flagyl &amp; Cipro not helping. He said they wouldn't do me any good.  Asked why I was taking? Told him because he prescribed. Said everything was great he'd see me in a yr. 6 weeks later I had surgery and 14"" of colon removed that was about to perforate",Male
"I've been a patient there for years and have not had great experiences. One time I waited in the lobby more than 2 hours past my appointment time for a colonoscopy (so it had been 36+ hours without eating.) He also did not monitor antibody levels to my medication, causing me to not be aware the medication was failing, then I wound up having to have surgery. Its also very difficult to get an appointment in a timely manner. Office hours are terrible, being only 9-1130 and 1-4 Monday through Fri.",Male

"Doesnt meet the needs. She wont go above and beyond for her patients. Indeed, she speaks chinese. If you are a Chinese speaking patient and expect her to ease your healthcare experience because of your language barrier, she wont be much of a help. She asked my mom (speaks no English) to talk to insurance company for her medication prescription along. It is hard to do even for anyone speaks English, but not in the medical field. She was very inpatient when you ask her for help. I have a bad experience with her.  I wont recommend her to anyone in the same situation. ",Female

I told her I gave to receptionist at time of visit, she then proceeds to speak negatively of her co workers. I've been hung up on my other staff &amp; when I attempted to communicate issues with Dr. Chen she never followed through with a return call. I end up cancelling my surgery.

My husband was able to leave the surgery center shortly after the surgery with clear urine seen in the drainage bag. The catheter was removed in 2 days and my husband is urinating much better now. Amazing doctor!!! Strongly recommend!!!,Male
"Lacking bed site manner; I felt as if I were a hinderance to her schedule and day.

This doctor doesn't even deserve one star! Dr Yaccoub has the worst bed side manner I've ever seen! He lack's compassion for his patients! I ended up having to have another surgery to fix what Dr yaacoub messed up! He was even rude to the all of the doctors that were caring for me at the other hospital in my city! I would never recommend this doctor! Not even to my worst enemy! Unfortunately there's not enough space to put my whole story because it needs to be told!,Male
I saw Dr Yaacoub for my kidney stones after going thru 4 surguries to remove the stones that were causing infections in me. When I first explained my situation to Dr yaacoub  he was very rude and arrogant to me!  He was so cocky about how much schooling he had done but no amount of schooling taught him to have compassion for his patients! He's the Worst doctor I've ever had the displeasure of meeting!!,Male
"After years of repeat UTI's and invasive treatments I came to Dr. Yaacoub for a second opinion, and I am so glad I did! He is thorough and he never makes you feel rushed. I like the fact that he calls to check on me, normally other Doctors have their staff contact you. Dr. Yaacoub also has a fantastic bedside manner and I am so happy with my new treatment plan, which is much more holistic. I wish I would have come to him sooner.",Male

Dr &gt;  Yaacoob has been taking care of my daughter for UTI and numerous kidney stones foe about 9 months.  He has helped her a lot.  She has a TBI making it harder for her treatment.  He is a wonderful Doctor and he has scheduled another surgery for her to help her even more. We give him  a   A Plus,Male
"This review is in behalf of my husband. I've been to a couple of appoints with him and Dr. Yacooub is fantastic. He is very patient, takes the time to explain everything and really knows what he is talking about. He is also a very nice person. My husband is very happy with him and we definitely recommend  him. ",Male
"Dr. Yaacoub saved my life, literally.  During a review of my cat scan for a kidney issue he went above and beyond and by so doing discovered a life threatening issue that if unaddressed, could have been fatal.  Dr. Yaacoub is the type Of doctor we all hope to be seeing.  I highly recommend Dr. Yaacoub to anyone that expects the very best care and attention from a doctor.  ",Male
" I met Dr. Yaacoub approximately four years ago and I consider him not only my fiancés urologist, but more as family. He not only provides exceptional care, his bed side manner is of the utmost best. He will go above and beyond, not only for his patients, but for any human being alive. He is the most sincere, kind hearted and caring physician I have ever met and encountered. He provides straight honest answers and we appreciate all he has done for us. I would HIGHLY recommend him. ",Male
"Did not bill insurance, did not bill me personally, didn't know there was outstanding debt until sent to collections. Very unprofessional!",Male
Dr. Yaakovian performed emergency gall bladder surgery on me on Christmas Eve... He saved my life!  He is a fine man and a wonderful surgeon!,Male
Dr. Yaakovian is a phenomenal physician. I can't thank him enough for being so attentive to my medical needs when I needed his assistance. He's definitely top notch! ,Male
Dr. Yaakovian is one of the best doctors that I've met.  His office staff is pleasant and prompt.  Dr. Yaakovian is a great listener and is willing to answer any questions and spend as much time as you need for him to spend with you.  He had to do a drain the infection out of the cyst but he was very careful and mindful to ensure i was comfortable and not in pain.  He went out of his way to see us regularly after the procedure becuase he knew i was more comfortable with the doctor.,Male

"I would highly recommend Dr Mina Yaar, her expertise with treating acne is amazing. She is very patient and explains the side effects of the medication thoroughly.",Female
"Dr. Yaar is a wonderful woman who is kind, caring and professional.  She listens to what you have to say and explained everything in a way I could understand.  I have a severe problem with psoriatic arthritis in my nailbeds which is very rare.  Dr. Yaar actually went ahead, on her own, and found a specialist at Mass General for me.  I am very grateful.  I definitely would recommend her!",Female
"This doctor takes the time to listen, answers any questions you may have. By far, this is the best doctor I've ever been to ",Male
"I was a patient of Dr Yabes from March 2017 through April 2020. Zero complaints and he and  his staff always treated my with courtesy, respect and professionalism. I would look more to the heavy regulations of Ca as to why he choose to work with a hospital and close his personal practice",Male
"Terrible was his patient for 6 yrs, med compliant, went every 2 months. Showed up at normal appt and he gave me the speech of hoe my payment was no longer accepted as of Jan 1st. No recommendation of a dr to go to or how to titrate off my meds. He just laughed and smiled opened his door said he was here to help. His staff is rude, catty and talk about patients in front of patients. They say rude things about the patient. WHELP the real story is he went out of business. So instead of just being honest he left many patients hanging. That is VERY SAD!! IMMORAL and Unethical",Male
"Your only as good as your help ! The staff is horrible . Rude, slow, unprofessional.  They talk badly about patients when they leave . The office manager is the worse . She talks horrible about Dr. Yabes.  She said "" he definitely has little man syndrome "" and ""he needs to care more about the people he treats and less about the money they generate ."" I think he needs to listen to his patients instead of just writing the prescription. I put up with his office for 10 years because of my insurance.  I finally got new insurance and a new Dr and have my life back . Stay away from here and find a real Dr that cares about your treatment!",Male
"They gave me my life back, the staff is amazing ",Male
Dr  Yabes and his staff are knowledgeable well trained and compassionate.  I could not have my life back without hard work and their help,Male
"Dr. Yabes is not only very rude and unprofessional but he is dedicated more to keeping his patients hooked on meds than he is to helping them get clean. His only concern and focus seems to be lining his pockets, not doing what is in the best interest of his patients. To merely say that his office staff is extremely rude is an understatement; I have met rattlesnakes that are more friendly and personable. For what it's worth, I would do my best to avoid this office at all cost! ",Male
"Dr has pleasant personality and is soft spoken. We trusted her. And she seemed very knowledgeable. However, the Nostrand office where doctor works one day a week, is horrible. My aunt was a patient there.
They dont return your phone calls. I tried getting in touch with them 3 different times for few different reasons over 2 weeks period.  
Either no one answers the phone, or the secretary says Dr, Faina is not available aside one day a week. 
How is it possible that your psychiatrist is not available to discuss worsening symptoms due to their patient’s a new meds regiment. 
I do not mean they have to be available 24 hours a day. Or available at night time. NO.
Just call or respond the same or the next day. 
Ridiculous!
SO, don’t go to that office if you need careful close monitoring of your symptoms or you meds.",Female

I absolutely recommend him without any reservation! ",Male
It is always refreshing when your doctor knows you and your history without the patient having to repeat themselves. She is friendly and knowledgeable. She doesn't give out no nonsense diagnosis. ,Female
I have been with Dr. Yablonski for over 25 yrs.  Great physician who is very personable and cares about her patients.,Female
"I have been seeing Dr. Yablonski for a long time. Over the years, I have had increasingly worsening menstrual issues and the issues just compounded over the years. Dr. Yablonski was very on top of the game with each of my yearly visits and genuinely cared about what I was dealing with. She was watching a fibroid for some years until it finally just grew to a size that concerned her, and I had also become anemic at this point. She recommended a hysterectomy at and would be checking the fibroid for cancer cells. Surgery went very well and I had as good of an experience as one could have after such an ordeal on your body. She was also wonderful while I was in the hospital and took time to make sure I was doing well. I would choose her again for this.",Female

Dr. Yablonski is fantastic. She cares about her patients and always follows up. Licking Memorial should be honored to have her. Her staff is fantastic too. Very nice.,Female
"I’d give 0 stars if I could. She’s very rude, unprofessional and laughs at you or makes jokes if you ask personal questions about your body. She didn’t tell me what they found on my Pap smear test for two years even though it came up positive for cancer cells. I left the room crying and she just went back to whatever she was doing, without caring.",Female
"Highly recommend Dr. Yablonski. She will take such great care of your loved ones. It’s apparent that she is extremely kind, genuine, professional and knowledgeable. She explained everything to me at a level I could understand (my background is in finance, not healthcare) which gave me peace of mind. Dr. Yablonski also has the absolute best personality.

"Dr. Yablonski has been the only OBGYN I have ever needed to go to. She delivered me as an infant, and throughout my life has provided excellent care for me. I travel around the country a lot, and I am always able to schedule my appointments, and get prescriptions as needed- regardless where I go. The wait is never too long to be seen, and she is swift and efficient in all procedures, and makes you feel comfortable. ",Female
I have gone to Dr Yablonski for over 23 years. She is very caring and helpful with my health needs. She encourages you to keep up with your yearly screenings to keep you in the best of health. I have recommended her to many of my friends and family. They have all been pleased with her practice.. Her staff is very polite and helpful too. I cant see myself ever going anywhere else..,Female
"I have never had such a cursory examination.  First the nurse took my blood pressure.  Period.  She did not take my pulse, count my respirations or measure my oxygen level.  When Dr. Yablonsky came in, his exam consisted of listening to my heart and lungs and looking in my throat.  Period.  He did not look in my eyes or ears.  He did no physical examination.  He did no poking around feeling for something unusual or some pain.  He did not do a breast exam.  Nothing.  This is the first physical examination I've had where I was not asked to disrobe.  

I had to ask to have my cholesterol and blood sugar level check, even though I mentioned that my mother was diabetic and that I had, in the past, been prediabetic when I wasn't careful about my eating habits.  The results of the tests were mailed to me on a postcard.  Both were simply checked:  ""Normal.""  When I saw a cardiologist two months later she said, ""No.  Your sugar level is not normal.  You are 8 points into the prediabetic range.""",Male
Dr. Yablonski was focused and very patient-centric.  He listened and displayed an old-fashioned concern for patients.,Male
I have recommended Dr. David Yablonsky to several people including relatives.  For the last nine years he has treated and guided me through several serious health issues.  He is a caring doctor who one can tell is a good person as well.  I am 60yrs old and he is the best doctor I've ever had.,Male
Got blood work done and had no idea I had low testosterone.  That explains my symptoms.  Dr. Yablonsky explained everything thoroughly and I couldn't be more satisfied.  Loved the office too!  So manly!,Male
"The doctor is the best I've been to.  Pleasant and personable.  His staff is rude, officious and overly regimented.  I called for an appointment, but because it had been too long since I'd seen him, I was reclassified as a ""new patient"".  And the appointments lady couldn't do that.  There is apparently such a major difference between scheduling an existing patient and a new patient that it takes two people to do it.  And the new patient desk was closed.",Male
"My mother is a new patient of this office. Called concerning a serious medical issue. The gave her an appointment 4 days later. She arrives 8minutes late because of a train, in horrible pain, crying, cannot feel her foot, toes are turning purple and they turn her away for being late. Said they could reschedule for next week or she could go to the ER. I have never heard of an office being so insensitive! closing at 12pm on a Friday was more important than the patients care.",Male
"Dr. Yablonsky is such a kind, caring doctor. He is easy to talk to and very personable. He has a wonderful staff. I would highly recommend them.",Male
Dr Yablonsky takes time to talk to you and DOESN'T make you feel like an idiot. He is more interested in treating you as a whole person and NOT just a dollar sign like many other doctors. ,Male
"Dr. Yablonsky was recommended to me by my chiropractor, who has been adjusting me twice a week  for chronic hip and back pain that my doctors have not been able to resolve. Dr. Yablonsky was very thorough with his assessment and never made me feel rushed. He gave me orders in hand for blood work and xrays that I had been trying to get my PCM to put in for AGES! He was very honest about what he thought and what the next few steps could be, which was greatly appreciated!",Male
"Staff was courteous and polite.  Dr. Yablonsky was on time, courteous, personable and knowledgeable.  He had a great bedside manner.  I would highly recommend Dr. Yablonsky to my friends and family.",Male
He listened to all of my concerns and was proactive about investigation into those issues. I didn't feel rushed. ,Male
"Dr. Yablonsky has a genuine concern for his patient's and will try whatever he feels necessary to get you feeling better &amp; back to your life. He is very personable, he looks at you while you are speaking to him and listening to every word to come up with a solution. He doesn't rush you &amp; very attentive to his patient's needs. I felt it necessary to update my review from June 2016. Now they have moved it appears to be so much more organized.",Male
"I began seeing Dr Yablonsky since 12/2015. He is very professional, thorough &amp; personable. I like him though I'm not sure what the issues are with his staff but it does seem to not be unorganized and not able to answer any question I had in each visit. I certainly hope it improves because I like him and a good Doctor is harder to find that one might think,",Male
you never get to see the dr unless you wait 3 wks to a month and then his interns have no personality,Male
My husband was recovering from Whipple surgery and wound up developing an aneurysm.    Dr. Yablonsky was woken up and rushed to the hospital and saved my husband's life.   He is an amazing doctor who worked countless hours to coil the aneurysm so that my husband would not have to go through another surgery.   He is also a wonderful person who takes care of everyone like they were family.  Thank God for Dr. Yablonsky!   ,Male
Dr. Yabumoto is a confident and knowledgeable provider. He was attentive and responsive to my needs and concerns. I recommend his services to anyone who needs pediatric care.,Male
"He had NO bedside manner, and acted as if I had came seeking pain meds. He treated me as if I knew nothing and talked down to me like I was less than him. It took a nurse requesting an ultrasound of my leg to find a blood clot, after he had said I was fine and tried to discharge me",Male
"The care, or lack thereof, that I received at NEA Baptist Hospital was not only unprofessional, but dangerous.

I went into the ER at NEA Baptist with complications from my autoimmune disease, which I was diagnosed with and have been treated for over the past 13 years. I went into the ER under a possible crisis situation. The ER doctor, Edmond P Yabut, walked in, and without asking me any questions about my symptoms or health, said that he thought I was ok.

During my entire visit, Dr. Yabut nev",Male
"He is my primary doctor when I am in NJ.  He always has time for an appointment even though
I am not a full time resident",Male
"Excellent experience. He explained everything very clearly, was very professional and thorough. Would highly recommend him.",Male
"I have been seeing Dr. Yachimski for about 5 years now.  I have had severe ulcers for my entire life and Dr. Yachimski is the only Provider I have seen that was caring, understanding and listened to my concerns.  I am on a treatment regimen that has kept me ulcer free and out of the hospital for over a year.",Male
"He was very rude and condescending to me. Refused to answer questions and ignored concerns. I continued to be polite throughout exam and tried to lightly joke, but he still maintained condescending attitude. Also cut me off many times, and made me too nervous to explain other symptoms, as I was afraid his behavior would become even worse. Sign in exam room states that no recording is allowed during office visits - now I know why.",Male
Good service ,Female
"I recently saw Dr Yachoui for a second opinion, which actually led to my current diagnosis. He instituted the treatment promptly. I have since improved rapidly. He is always available to respond to questions and emails. Great doctor. ",Male
"Not interested in listening.  Disregarded my medical history and symptoms, and told me I did not have arthritis.",Male
Very thorough and helpful,Male
"I waited 2 months for my appointment and what a waste of time.  He was in such a rush, he barely listened to me and had his nose in his computer the majority of the time.  He only examined the problem areas I had and nothing more; even though, his report states he did a full exam.  Even after I told him multiple times about a past reaction to a medication that is even listed in my chart, he still insisted on prescribing it and didn't offer any other suggestions.",Male
I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and had been treated at another facility and was getting worse. An appointment was arranged for me with Dr. Yachoui. He immediately recognized that I needed immediate care and arranged for me to be hospitalized. I am receiving appropriate treatment. When ever I have had a problem he has been very attentive and helpful.  I found him to be compassionate. I am on the road to recovery thanks to him. I can not thank him enough.,Male
Dr. Yachoui and the entire office truly have been so supportive from the first point of diagnosis to now the continued management of my condition - truly grateful for all of their help!,Male
"Dr. Yachoui was very kind and empathic. he seemed to have broad knowledge in arthritis, which help me in the management of my disease. I also appreciated the great follow up and would recommend him to future patients. ",Male
He was excellent. He took his time to explain my condition. I have seen before him about five rhumatologist that missed my diagnosis. He was the first to diagnose me correctly and it was a rare condition that no one other than him knew about. I am so glad to have him as my doctor. ,Male
"Dr. Yachoui didn't do a physical exam for range of motion, always seemed to be in a hurry and didn't listen. Wanted to know if he gave me enough pills and sent me on my way.  I have RA and really needed someone to listen and understand. I have since changed providers and am VERY happy that I did. My RA after seeing Dr. Yachoui was still uncontrolled and I wasn't to see him for another 8 months. Absolutely would NOT recommend him to anyone!",Male
Very professional and thorough. ,Male
Office is too rushed and busy for my taste. 55 minute wait time is unconscionable.,Male
"He knows his business, however, barely 3 questions asked and he was out the door.  :(  Wish more time were spent with bedside manner.",Male
" My husband and mother in law both had rotator cuff repairs and the surgeries went great!!  He had to revise my husbands surgery due to a mess up by another surgeon!   They both had excellent recoveries and have full range of motion and no pain!!!  Dr. Yacisen spends time explaining and answering any questions you have, love his bedside manner!! Now my daughter has torn her ACL and I new immediately who to call, I have total trust and admiration for Dr. Yacisen, I know my child is in great hands",Male
"I had a followup appointment for a condition that I had been sent to OT to attempt conservative treatment as opposed to surgery.  I was in the waiting room for approximately a 1/2 hour.  I then spent an hour in the exam room waiting to be seen.  I couldn't wait any longer because I had another appointment, plus an hour and a half at a doctor's office and still not being seen is completely unacceptable anyway.  I will not go back or recommend.",Male
He is the best  sergeant my son and I have both had him he is the best he tell you what he is going to do and if you don't understand he will explain it to you so you do understand I would go back to him and have my son go back to him he has great bed side  matter ,Male
"Well this was the  worst experience at a doctors office we ever. Had a appointment at 8:15 am the first one in office even before all personal showed up ,called back 8:21am put in room 8:47 am still no Doctor. Ask when Doc.would be in, be a couple mins,now mad left this office never to return. Why make appointment at 8:15 and wait almost a hour as we was the first in and waiting room had 7 others after us Good luck to them,the best part is it was only to talk about a up coming surgery.",Male
He's the best and I can finally walk again! ?? ,Male
"The day of the surgery, he hardly said three sentences to me, and when i was in recovery he was supposed to talk to my husband. He never bothered to and all he did with me was ask me a few questions and rush off. Came across as full of himself but was not very good",Male
"Had a knee replacement  found out 1 year out after much pain and him rolling me it was just scared tissue ,,, from another surgeon that the replacement was put in wrong, at the wrong angle and the wrong type.  Needless to say after a revision from another surgeon everything is perfect and I am seeking an attorney for lost work , pain and suffering and emotional distress.

"I went to see Dr Yack yesterday' I have been having a lot of pain in my right heel, not only do I have a bone spur, but Dr Yack told me some very important information I needed to know and what I can do, and she spent time with me and explained just how important the shoes you wear are,  I do not have insurance but I was treated with respect. The front desk window the girls were very nice,  I still have the pain in my foot today,  she doesn't deal with bone spurs but I also found out I possible have a stress fracture which is a tiny crack in the bone, and that might just be a lot of my pain, but seeing Dr. Yack was well worth the money I paid just to know the information was a BIG help.  she gave me meds to help with swelling or inflammation.   I would highly recommend Dr Yack.",Female
STAY AWAY!!!!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!! YOUR BETTER OFF GOING TO LOCAL NAIL SOLON AND HAVING UNLICENSED PEDICURIST HELP WITH YOUR FEET!!! AT LEAST THEY WILL BE CLEAN!!,Female
"I called the office to determine what the service would cost to get toe nails clipped and foot exam (I have diabetes). The office said it would be covered by my insurance except $35 co-pay. Just received a bill for additional $ 66.00

If I had know that I would not have gone.  BTW the Office Visit alone is 
$ 74.0.0.
Probably will not go back- I do not like to be missed informed.",Female
I saw Dr. Yack as a new patient. The front office was very nice. My visit with Dr. Yack was informative and pleasant. I was embrassed of my feet and the guy who took me back made me feel comfortable also my wait time was minimal. I would definitely recommend her.,Female
"My wife walks on the sides of her feet...doctor hadn't looked at her feet and said, you are born with your feet. Seriously? I didn't need a doctor to tell me that. She then explained cost for orthodics, which she DID NOT offer to my wife, just explained the cost.  Told my wife to stop being cheap and buy new shoes.  Then she got up and left...Guess the appointment was over.",Female
I am going to another Podiatrist now she was rude. The office is very cluttered I was not impressed,Female
"I visited Dr. Yack two times. The office was not modern, however, I have NO complaints with the care or recommendations provided.
Down to earth Dr. that provides a good service. ",Female
"Find another doctor! She is in the profession for your money. She does the very least to help you but will definitely collect cash. Unfortunately, I went to her twice because she had a very open flexible schedule. I would not recommend her to anyone. ",Female
"Catherine Yack was horribly unprofessional. She complained about her son and grandchild during my visit the first time, I returned again to give benefit of the doubt.  Same nasty demeanor and dirty office.  I would not recommend or return. ",Female
All she wanted is my money. Very unprofessional. Staff member smokes and smelled terrible. She even made a disparaging remark about my parents.,Female
Very unfriendly. She spent less than 5 mins with me and complained the entire time about my insurance and how little they reimburse. She implied that she didn't want to do a medical procedure on my foot because of how little my insurance reimburses her. If she doesn't like my insurance she shouldn't take it. I will be finding another doctor to see in the Huntsville area. I would not recommend her to anyone I know.,Female
"My 75 year old mother had an appointment with Dr. Yackee.  We waited over 1 1/2 hours to be seen.  Once in the room, he refused to listen, gave very vague answers to my questions.  When I was trying to give him information regarding concerns (since I am now the care taker for my mother), he talked over me...clearly not listening and done intentionally.  He tried to leave the room once and I had to loudly say that I had questions...of which none were fully answered.  He abruptly left without asking if we had anything else of concern.  We did not even know if we were to make another appointment considering she was having a biopsy the following week.  No communication, sharing of information......he made us feel like we were an inconvenience to his day.  Suburban Hospital requested that we see her cardiologist after a fall that occurred weeks before.  DO NOT see this doctor; DO NOT have him treat you.  There are so many competent, caring, cardiologists...HE IS NOT ONE!  Disgusting!!!!!!!!",Male
"Very rushed, made assumptions.  Felt like he considered me a waste of his time. ",Male
He was over 30 minutes late for the appointment.  He was abrupt (spent less than 10 minutes in the room) and failed to ask if there were any questions or concerns.  He recommended an invasive procedure but offered no literature or in-depth explanation of what it involves.  His staff was friendly but I will never darken his door again and will certainly not let him do any invasive procedure!,Male
Dr Yackley is litterly a breath of fresh air compared to my previous Dr. He hears what I have to say and is patient. He acts according and makes sure that what he is planning to do is explained. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for his fast actions.,Male
"Dr. Yackley is my doctor, my mothers and used to be my fathers. We love him. He always welcomes us with a smile, hello, and a handshake. He listens to everything we say, and he explains things to us so that we can understand what is going on. He takes his job seriously, but is always friendly, courteous and funny. We can all joke with each other. He really does care about his patients. My family would recommend him to everyone.",Male
"In September of 2012 Dr. Yacko was the anesthesiologist on my knee replacement surgery. Dr. Yacko’s office sent my bill to the wrong address, although my current address was in the Community Hospital network! The bill went to a collection agency because I never received it! I immediately paid the bill when notified but it affected my good credit and still five years later it affects my credit!!! I tried everything to get the matter resolved since it was not my fault but I got the runaround!",Male
Dr. Mark was my anesthesiologist a few weeks ago.  He was very caring and a wonderful bedside manner.  I was very impressed with him,Male
"He seems to care, communicates clearly and listens to my concerns regarding treatment, which is more than I can say for most psychiatrists I've seen. He's also one of the only ones I've seen who has never had an issue with treating my ADHD. I've never had a problem getting on-time refills from his office either.",Male
"In order to treat patients with mental illnesses, you need to have a certain personality and it has to be that of CARING. Patients are less likely to feel safe confiding in a doctor that just acts clinical with no emotion. He also has an air of arrogance and talked down to me. I’ve been going to psychiatrists and therapists for 21 years. I’d rather have a doctor not know what they’re doing and I can tell than deal with someone who treats me as a case, not a person. This place went COMPLETELY downhill when Dr. Creson passed away and Diane Snow retired. They were caring and competent.",Male
"ALWAYS at least 30 minutes to an hour late to your scheduled appointment. Doesn’t really listen to you. Seems like he just waits for you to stop talking to tell you a completely unrelated story about his own life. He is THE definition of a “man-splainer”. He’s all about prescribing you ADHD medication cause one of his children was diagnosed with it, and I guess that’s the first diagnosis he goes to. So if adderall, vyvanse, and ritalin is what your looking for, he’s your guy.",Male
"A psychiatrist who really listens to, and gets to know his patients. I drive an hour to see him rather than see anyone else. ",Male
"This psychiatrist raged at me in anger during a session. Completely unprovoked and unacceptable. Prior to the outburst, he had been ineffective for quite some time. Moving on. ",Male
"super nice Physician . doesn't rush through your visit.
Very caring",Male
Dr Yucalik is a very understanding man. He listens and doesn't judge you and he isn't there to numb you out with medicine. I highly recommend him! ,Male
"I've been a patient of Dr. Yackulic's for 3 years.  He is attentive, respectful and takes his time to ask the right questions and explore all possibilities.  I had tried several other psychiatrists before him, all of whom asked me a list of vague questions, then shoo'd me out the door after 15 minutes with a bunch of new pills I didn't need or understand!  Dr. Yackulic actually spent the time to dig deeper and think critically about my issues, then explained multiple treatment options.",Male
"Excellent! Did wonders for me! Thankyou Dr. Yacob, you are sorely missed!",Male
Worse experience ever.  Took 6 months to sign off the report from my visit.  Arrogant and no help.,Male
He saved my life isn’t about money ?? like some of the other doctor ????? I’ve had I recommended him crazy ?? you go anywhere else thanks ?? for being a great doctor ?? sir ,Male
A great man and doc !!!!!,Male
listened intently to my wife's problems and discussed them with her before making a diagnosis.  offered us a couple of treatment options before my wife sees her pcp. explained her diagnosis in words we could understand.,Female
"I’ve been seeing Dr. Yacobucci for five years now. With age comes issues, and  he always has a solution. He has my trust and I enjoy all my visits with him.
I highly recommend him",Male
"Very informative and truly takes an interest in what your needs are. Never felt hurried, answered all questions and offered multiple paths for my care.",Male
"Dr Yacobucci gave me my life back. I was an avid hiker, and devastated by an ACL injury. I was able to get back to my sport in record time post surgery. His compassion was equally amazing ",Male
This doctor has a great bedside manner. Very knowledgeable and knows his joints. Always a pleasure seeing him and his staff. I highly recommend him for his services.,Male
"I am a retired surgical device sales rep, so I have the means to identify the best surgeons in Phoenix to address my knee osteoarthritis.  I chose Dr. Yaccobucci.  He is a very competent physician with outstanding interpersonal skills.  He always recommends a conservative approach and never pushes surgery as a rat option.  I would highly recommend him.",Male
"Great ""bedside manner"", very clear communicator, promptly assessed my issue and presented an outstanding solution.",Male
"Great doctor, iam very happy with his treetmen on my knees",Male
Dr. Yacobucci and Matt are great doctors!,Male
He is a great surgeon and a friendly person. He has such a positive outlook. His confidence is contagious. He told me I would soon be feeling better after shoulder surgery and he was right. I'm getting to feel like my old self again.,Male
"Dr. Yacobucci took his time explaining my condition to me and if his remedy didn’t work, what next steps would be.",Male
Dr Yacobucci and his assistant Matt are both WONDERFUL!!! Very helpful and friendly! I highly recommend them!,Male
"PA who did shoulder injection was
Fantastic. Helped me relax &amp; shot barely hurt",Male
Very sympathetic with very good bedside manners. Was able to diagnose the problem and provide relief from pain during initial visit. Very straight forward and not pushing any unnecessary treatments. Greatly recommend,Male
After months of pain Dr Yacobucci started me on a great track. I can’t thank him enough. Being new to Phoenix we went on recommendations of friends in the medical community. He and his staff(both medical &amp; administrative) have guided us through the process. Thank you,Male
Listens attentively and provides excellent care.,Male
Excellent doctor with a really great bedside manner!,Male
"Appointment time was exact no waiting to go back. Friendly and informative on everything that was being done.

Great experience and great doctor",Male
Two shoulders done by Dr. Yacobucci and I am back!  This guy is not only a tremendous surgeon but he’s a heck of a nice guy too. One of the best bedside manners I’ve ever witnessed and I work in healthcare. I cannot leave out his team either...Matt is an incredible PA!  Michelle is a great nurse and the rest of the scheduling team are superb. PT team is a great group as well. Really helped me recover quickly. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Yacobucci and his team at TOCA.,Male
Dr. Yacobucci is always no nonsense with his approach.  Starts with least cost and complicated approaches first and solves my issues for both my knee and now shoulder.  I would highly recommend him.  X Rays were done on site and made immediately available.  TOCA is a world Class establishment and they have their act together. I got in to see him in less tan a week which made me very happy.,Male
Excellent. I got up the courage to propose marriage to dr Gregory quetin Marsella. Dr y cured my low self esteem,Male
"Horrible! Highly unprofessional, demeaning, and offensive man. He does not care about what is best for his patients and seems to only be concerned w abusing his power for a quick ego boost. This was, by far, the worst treatment I have ever received from a health care “professional” and I would never recommend him to anyone. He doesn’t even deserve one star. Stay away!",Male
Very caring physician who takes the time to listen!,Male
"Dr. Yacono has been, and still is, someone who treats me with kindness, respect and provides caring and professional attention. As my primary care physician he has seen to all my needs, but more importantly, he has referred me to exceptionally talented and knowledgeable specialists when required. The speed in which specialists see me has been amazing, and it is truly appreciated. I feel very comfortable with all options he offers, and all decisions he makes on my behalf. I am fortunate indeed.",Male
"Dr Yacono is very thorough and takes the time to fully understand what your problem is. He is the only Dr that has been able to get my blood pressure under control. On top of being a great physician, he has a good sense of humor and a very pleasant bedside manner.",Male
"Dr. Yacono is WONDERFUL. She is compassionate and understanding. She gives you all the time you need and explains everything thoroughly. She is ALWAYS accessible and responsive. Sharon, her nurse, is wonderful and helpful as well!",Female
Dr.Yacoob is a pleasant dr. She is very knowledgeable and honest. I had a dr of internal medicine that moved and neglected to find a new primary dr. I was very pleased about the dr. Visit and all of the staff they are friendly and down to earth! ,Female
Very knowledgeable and caring. ,Female
"Dr Yacoob schedules tests, does no follow up and has little compassion. She does not appear concerned or even interested tgat I am in constant pain. I recommend finding another physician.",Female
She really personal and informative.  I feel that she is a great choice for me as a personal physician.,Female
"friendly and matter of fact, gave me an easy to understand plan of action",Female
"Great, no problem, in and out, got my   updated immunizations, the website is so easy to make appointments.",Female
"Dr. Carmela Yacoob is a kind &amp; caring doctor, who listens well &amp; takes excellent care of her patients. Highly recommend!",Female
Dr. Yacoob is an exceptional physician. Very caring.,Female
I have been going to Dr. Yacoob fir many years now and I feel that she is a very caring person and is very concerned of my well being. My sister goes to see her and so does my niece. My daughter also did but then she moved to San Diego. My mother does not cause she is elderly and it’s to far for her to go to see Dr.  Yacoob. I would not go to anyone else but Dr. Yacoob,Female
"The most human doctor I have had in the US. A great listener, a great practitioner. Very careful to details, excellent follow up. I wish my insurance allowed me to still be her patient. Big loss for me.",Female
"I am a physician who is of the belief that a Doctor who has himself or his family as. patients  is a fool. After 40 years in practice, I am very aware of the skills of the other doctors in the area. I chose Dr Yacoob as the primary care physician for myself and my wife and am very happy I did. She is knowledgeable, personable, affiliated with the best hospital in Orange County and refers to top specialists.",Female

The BEST!

The office staff might not be the best (and often times VERY frustrating) but it's worth it to see someone who will listen and get to the problem. Don't mistake the staff for an amazing Dr! 

Dr. Yacoob has been my Dr since 2009 and my fiancé &amp; his daughter for ??? ever. As soon as I saw her, she knew what was wrong with me. Which I've struggled with my entire life. I truly adore her like a mother. She's that warm &amp; comforting. 
If she retires-- When she retires, I'm going to be sad. We almost switched to Kaiser, since all the issues with insurance companies currently, and every time I thought of it, my eyes tested up. Due to that, we ended up staying on our current insurance for her! THE ONLY REASON!
There's other Dr's in the office but she is the one that is ALWAYS in demand. 

I promise you'll adore her &amp; be glad she's your Dr, if you choose her. 
Even my fiancé's sister goes to see her.",Female
"Dr. Yacoob is a very professional, caring and compassionate doctor.  I feel very comfortable at each visit, and she answers all my question explaining everything in a way that is easy for anyone to understand. She really is a great doctor, I would highly recommend her to all my family and friends. ",Female
"I love this woman! She treats me like I'm her family. I feel so comfortable with her &amp; I have felt that way since the first time I saw her - 2009. 
She is an amazing doctor.",Female
I absolutely love this woman! She makes me feel like family. I don't know what I'd do without her! ,Female
Dr. Yacoob is very patient and caring. She asks questions and is knowledgeable. She always explains things. It is very difficult to find such caring and good doctor. ,Female
Dr. Yacoob is very kind and caring.  She listens to her patients and spends an appropriate amount of time taking care of you.  She is excellent!,Female
Dr. Yacoob is an amazing and very trust worthy Dr.  She is very thorough in everything she does.   Our whole entire family have been going to her for the past 20 years,Female
Dr Yacoob is an amazing diagnostician and a wonderful doctor,Female
"The nurses working in the office are very incompetent. I had taken a blood test and never heard back of the results until I called back after 20 days waiting, when I realized that the doctor hasn't looked at it yet and I couldn't get back the result on the phone. So I had to call again the next day.",Female
"My experience with Dr. Yacoub was absolutely the Best!
Very smart, kind and you know you are in  good hands when you spend very little time with him. He knew all my details when he entered the room. Anyone needing a hematologist would be lucky to be in his care! THANK YOU Dr. Yacoub, I really appreciate you being in my camp!
Stan Lifetime Patient 1/13/2020",Male
"Absolutely terrible. Went to see Dr. Yacoub for a second opinion with my mother. He was dismissive of all of her questions and gave us the run around on her cancer merely repeating information we already knew. Made the encounter very uncomfortable by interrupting family members and stating he was the doctor over and over and that we needed to unlearn a lot of things (never mentioned what that was).  Also uncomfortable was him holding my mothers hand and touching her leg the entire time. My mother left more worried and frustrated than when she came in, he has no concept or respect for quality of life and just wanted to push meds and expensive testing. Never introduced the nurse or the med student and left them standing silent the entire meeting, clearly he does this a lot as the med student was so bored she was texting / on snapchat and eventually just sat on the counter in the room.",Male
"He gave me the bums rush at KU Med. He did not listen at all as I was trying to give my health history. On his insistence I had a painful, expensive and unnecessary bone marrow biopsy.",Male
" It was one of the worst appointments of my life. He was dismissive said he only treated oncology which I found out later was a frank lie.  Ordered a ton of expensive testing to exclude me that if I didn’t except it would make me seem as if I was a non-compliant patient.  Yet he wouldn’t refer me to a hematologist until all my testing came back. It was awful. He was awful. I  I am so sick, therefore I don’t recommend him.",Male
"Dr Yacoub has been treating me for my two cancers since December of 2015 and I really enjoy having him. He explains everything really good, asks me what I think I would like to do. He goes over test results and his nurse is really good at responding to my messages.",Male
"I've been with Dr. Yacoub for 6 months. I'm sad I didn't come see him sooner!! He's super easy to talk to, makes you feel right at home. Most importantly, he's on top off things! His nurse always follows up with lab results and always response to my emails.",Male
"Excellent specialist, I cannot say enough about this physician whom saved my husband's life with so much professionalism and compassion!",Male
Dr. Yacoub has been treating my husband for lymphoma for 1-1/2 years. Before him he was getting his treatment somewhere else. Switching to Dr. Yacoub has been life saving. He is an excellent doctor all the way around. His bedside manner is excellent and he goes out of his way to get you all need to get back to recovering. When things looked bleak he kept on looking for solutions. I believe Dr. Yacoub is why my husband is still enjoying life. We are extremely grateful for his expertise!,Male
"Dr. Yacoub treated my husband for cancer this past year. He explains everything so that it is easily understood,  has a great sense of humor. Has excellent patient relations skills.",Male
"Getting a cancer diagnosis and then dealing with the process of adapting and healing is stressful, scary and hard. Dr. Yacoub has quite literally saved my life. But he's also been thoughtful, kind and supportive. He's compassionate and actually listens to me while giving me the hope and courage to push on. His belief in me gives me such hope and self awareness.  I know I am in good hands with him. I trust him, his staff and the entire KU Cancer Center is phenomenal. ",Male
"He is the best, as a Doctor and has a great sense of  humor and is always straight forward with you and has your best interest at heart. ",Male
"My mom was a patient with Dr. Atef Yacoub. Due to bladder issues she wears a permanent catheter, and the catheter is replaced once a month. In the beginning of this year she suffered multiple UTI's and was rushed to the ER once a week for a month to have it replaced. Catheter's are not meant to be exchanged that often and the ER doctor suggested she see her Urologist as soon as possible. The ER  always ran test on her and her result always came back positive for UTI's.  
The day we took her to see Dr. Yacoub, her primary doctor had faxed over all the hospital records. After Dr. Yacoub examine her he said to me that he didn't understand why she was there. That the hospital reports show ""No Infection"" that she is okay, and they he is going to suggest a psychological evaluation! As I stood there telling him how, I don't understand how that is  possible, and how I've been in the ER when they have said to me she has a UTI. He said no, show me where it said on the report, and that its all in",Male
"He said Ciprofloxacin is 100% safe and nobody ever had a reaction to it in his 30 years experience, and if you do that you need to see a psychiatrist. Does that sound like somebody that wants you to be safe and healthy? Cipro is black boxed for a reason, a chemotherapy fluoride antibiotic that kills everything even you and it has ruined countless lives, how do you not learn this in 30 years? I asked students on campus and staff if they knew of Cipro, and many people said they had a bad reaction",Male
"I have been seeing Dr.Yacoub for over a year.   He is professional, intelligent and very caring.   I would have no problem recommending him to anyone.",Male
"My primary physician referred me to Dr Yacoub in December 14, 2018 with my suspected diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.  After the a brief exam he performed some kind of test by placing a cap on my head &amp; telling me it was ok if I fell asleep.  This test took about one hour.  He promised to send his report to my Primary the next day.  He did not.  I called him about every other day with no response.  My Primary started calling him with no response.  Meanwhile, my condition continued to get worse.  Finally, my Primary referred me to another neurologist in May to be diagnosed and treated. 

I received a statement from Medicare showing that he billed for all kinds of test not performed and using the name of a primary other than mine. 

This doctor has serious problems.  I do not recommend him.",Male
Uhggggggg,Male
"Wonderful Doctor! Office staff, not so much. No one ever answers the phone. Leave all the messages that you wish, it doesn't matter. Every month, it's the same game trying to get meds refilled. I call and leave message prior to running out. No response. Call again in a week, still nothing. Usually, after the 3rd call, I still won't hear anything. Then, at some point I'll receive a call from the pharmacy that my meds are ready for pick-up. This happens EVERY month. So sad, as he's an awesome doctor.",Male
"great first visit, promising even. then, it all changed. doesn't answer phone calls, will call back MAYBE in about 2 months.  Now, we've lost all contact with him and our new neurologist can't even get in touch with him to get the records of the EMG he performed.  Poor practice.",Male
"Dr. Yacoub is a very kind &amp; compassionate Neurologist. Patients and their care come first and he protects his patient's rights (complying w/HIPAA and even beyond). My husband suffers seizures occasionally but Dr. Yacoub doesn't put him on unnecessary drugs for extended lengths of time and is a very goid listener and progressive Neurologist. I would highly recommend him to any loved one, friend or co-worker. My husband has been a patient since Sept. 2014.",Male
"Doctor Yacoub is educated qualified &amp; professional. I agree with the positive comments regarding Dr Yacoub and have no comments regarding negatives.
Building doctors and patients relationships require some degree of reciprocity. Thank you for allowing this comment.
Francis Tindal",Male
"If you looking fo a Doctor who won't return your calls, who's never in the office, who doesn't have anyone answering the office phone, Dr Yacoub is your man. He coded some test that I had done at LabCorp wrong, I tried by fax, phone to get it straightened out with no results, I wound up paying the $385.00, it's not worth my time and effort to hunt this guy down. Dr Yacoub, told me that I had epilepsy, and never reviewed, or sent any records to anybody. I will be filing a complaint with the AMA.",Male
"AWFUL! never returns phone calls. waited 3 months for mri script. RX refills not called/faxed or electronically sent. ignores your symptoms just sits there and smiles. still after 6 months-- yes 6 months, no script for bloodwork. i refuse to ride to his office to get it- shouldn't have to!
your first visit will be wonderful after that... good luck!!!!! you will need it.",Male
"like the other reviews....phone calls never returned, does not follow through, still waiting for RX and blood work script. blew off some questions . just smiled when i was explaining my symptoms. 
ashame because he is very, very nice and respectful. 
will NOT be going back. scheduled to see another doctor ",Male
"Very respectful,patient and caring ,,,,he listens to what you say to him ,,,,a very very good Dr. ",Male
Still waiting 2 months for a return call.  He seems okay in the office but didn't seem to remember us after 3 appointments.  This is not professional.,Male
Dr appears to be one nice fella but why doesn't the staff return phone calls? Dr acts so friendly but when it gets down to business he just doesn't follow up. Oh well I have to find another dr because this isn't professional. Maybe he used to perform well since he has awards hanging up all around his office or maybe staff made the award certificates themselves.  Who knows maybe he's just tired &amp; really wants to retire. I'll do him a favor &amp; go elsewhere because I understand. My Farewells. ,Male
"I have a child on a controlled medication that is prescribed through this office , I have called 3 times over past 2 weeks to get medication refilled. Still no medication and my child started school Thursday. This is very unprofessional and harmful to patients. Its a shame because he is a very nice man and works wonderfully with children. And he actually listens to parents and their concerns, which is a very rare find.",Male
"Highly recommend Dr. Yacoub. He's professional, attentive, and really cares about his patients. Never will use another!",Male
Never did what hesaidhewasgoing to do.  Neither he nor office returns calls.  False hope given at first appointment with no follow through.  Also has a habit of cancelling apps and closing the office without notice.,Male
"Office never returns calls, office staff is constantly changing.
Appointments are rescheduled without any notice and office staff claim to have called.
An overall unprofessional experience that never failed to disappoint me. ",Male
He NEVER returns calls and does not follow through with what he says he's going to do.  Made me wait over a month for a MRI script and I finally had to change doctors.  VERY unsatisfied!!  This is not the way to run a practice!  I would not recommend this doctor!,Male
Never followed through. Never helped with anything. Continued to blame my insurance company and lead me along for months before never responding to a phone call.  ,Male
"Terrible!!! NP, Albert Liu, was more concerned about his personal goals than mine.  I’ve seen 3 psychiatrists and none of them pressured me off a med as he did. And, he wanted to do it every two weeks.  Is it the money he is looking for?  I felt more anxiety listening to him than prior to getting on the video call.",Male
"Terrible. You can’t breathe in there because: 
1. Stale dust everywhere 
2. No ventilation 
3. No air because the crowded area is fully packed with people who are breathing their own CO2 since air for humanly lungs doesn’t exist in there.
4.  It stinks in there, so breathing, if it were possible, would be an unpleasant experience. 

The wait is about an hour past the actual appointment, so you’re in there breathing other peoples breath. The staff is just as stifling and alarming as the air.",Male
"I have waited in a baren room for three hours waiting to be seen. The appointment made me almost an hour late to work. When front desk staff is asked they are apathetic and unhelpful. Waited over an hour and a half to be seen after i asked the first time and was told i would be seen “shortly”. When asked a second time i was told there was an emergency wth another patient and that he had just returned. 

Why on earth was I not told? Why was I left completely in the dark? They have me hostage because i cannot go wothout my medication but wont give me a script without seeing the doctor?

I am disgusted by how this office is run. I will never be here again.",Male
"I saw an Intern at the doctors office and was prescribed an anti-depressant. Three days after starting the meds I was experiencing unusual side effects and called the doctors office out of concern and had a friendly conversation with whomever answered and was told I would receive a call from the nurse later that day. Two days after that, not having received a call, I called again and left a message this time. No return call ever. I subsequently called 3 weeks later to cancel my scheduled appt. and still hadn't heard from them. This was an awful experience that I would not wish upon anyone",Male
Unethical Prescription Mill.  Nurse Practitioner and free interns do all the work.  Horrible staff.  2hrs in stinky small waiting room with not enough chairs.,Male
Their front desk clerk gives her own bad breath Tonsillitis diseases to all patients because they have sick ill workers breathing on patients and instead of Ehab Yacoub they force a nurse on you WITHOUT telling you then they try to force a STUDENT to replace the nurse ,Male
"Horrible office, horrible staff, horrible DOCTOR!  You have been warned to stay away from this office they do not give one hoot about their patients, their only concern is getting office copays.  The office manager is rude and antagonistic.  The office is dirty and dusty.  Plus they tried to overcharge me what my insurance said my copay would be.  Run away from this doctor!",Male
"Dr Yacoub is actually a pretty nice man, however, dealing with his office staff has been a nightmare.  In December, the office was supposed to fax a prescription for me to the pharmacy and they accidentally and repeatedly faxed the prescription to MY CELL PHONE.  When I called the office to let them know their mistake, it took approximately 5 calls and ultimately one from my mother, in order to get the situation straightened out.  
At my most recent appointment in April, I was told my copay was",Male
"Horrendous office staff. I was given his number by my insurance and I called 4 times over a month period before I FINALLY got a returned call. When I spoke with the man who called me back he was INSANELY rude. I was confused by what he was telling me so I was simply asking him to clarify if the doctor was or wasn't seeing new patients. I'm sorry but, learn how to better communicate a simple yes or no answer. He finally told me ""I think you should just find a different doctor."" And hung up on me!",Male
"Waited over half an hour for several appointments that were scheduled for 8AM, last visit I counted about 28 people who were either already in or came in while I waited to be called in, waiting room holds about 10 people and some were waiting outside the office. One appointment I was seen by a different doc because Yacoub was too busy. Front desk lady leaves appointment messages so short and quiet I have to listen multiple times with my phone on speaker. Not impressed.",Male
"Horrible experience.  Was called in about 40 minutes after the appointment time and waited another 30 minutes to be seen, right before getting ready to walk out.   I was not even seen by Yacoub, but another psychiatrist.  He said Yacoub was there but it was very busy.  The waiting room was extremely overcrowded, people coming in could not find a seat and had to stand.  I get the impression this psychiatrist, or maybe the whole office double books.",Male
"Completely fallen through the cracks. My 13 year old was in the ER, I left a message on the urgent line. The Dr never did make contact with us or with the team caring for her on 72 hour hold. I should have gotten a hint we were referred here for an urgent appointment a month earlier. Once we arrived were asked if if it was OK to just see the nurse. I said this was critical and a first time evaluation, so important to be seen by the doctor. When we were taken in, it was with the nurse only.",Male
"I've been going to Dr. Yacoub for over a year now for Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD. Not only has he been successfully treating these disorders but he actually listen to what I have to say. The thing I like about Dr. Yacoub is that he actually listens to my suggestions about medications and he decides whether that medication is in my best interest. His office staff is simply the best. They deal with my annoying insurance company every time we have a problem. I just love this practice! ",Male
I really hate this place with a fiery passion. I'm finding a new psychiatrist after my last appointment. I waited over an hour to be seen for a 10 minute appointment.,Male
Horrible experience. The staff is so rude.  The wait is awful   Dr Yacoub could care less about his patients. ,Male
Always get a 2nd opinion if he is 1st,Male
"He intentionally gave me the wrong injections in my back. He blatantly lied about it, only to find out months later by the office that he was released from.",Male
Claims pain management but is pushing pain pumps on all his patients. Run. This practice is a racket. $4000 every 3 months to fill them.,Male
"Dr. Yacoub is a fantastic physician. He is very compassionate, professional and always very thorough. From day 1 he has taken such such wonderful care of me, explaining things carefully to make certain I understood, listening and answering all my questions. I would come into each appointment armed with questions from researching my condition and looking at my scan results in MyWakeHealth. He couldn't have been nicer or more professional and truly listed to me. I felt like we were working together and it was fantastic. Going though cancer treatment is not an experience anyone would wish for but Dr. Yacoub was truly a blessing in that time.  He also has continued to look at my labs across the board and make the necessary adjustments and referrals for treatment outside of his scope of practice.  He is AMAZING.",Male
Saved my life,Male
He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in listening to my mother and what her needs are.  Bedside manner is awful.  Seems to think COPD is a death sentence and make no real effort to increase quality of life.  Rather it is almost as if he wants to punish the person for getting COPD in the first place.,Male
"Very quick appt. but he helped me get a new CPAP machine where it took others 3 appts. or more and got nothing done.
He was very helpful.
His staff out front were average.",Male
"I have always found Dr Yacoub to be very caring. If you have to wait did you ever consider he has more than one patient, he is through and doesn’t need a long time to diagnose most situations because he is so well versed and experienced, he is not there to make friends but to give you competent diagnosis, . I have found him to be very caring even through he doesn’t spend time making friends. His nurse ask questions and fills him in before he sees you. That’s sufficient enough for me. ",Male
"Horrible!!  He gives you 3 minutes and after the first minute he’s heading toward door. Wait time is at least an hour, different staff every time. Called his office 4 times and no answer. Office answering machine still states they are open Friday’s... they are not. Definitely ISO a new provider. They money you pay for a specialist and this is the best they have to offer?",Male
Dr. Yacoub seems to be a pretty knowledgeable and nice guy but the office and nursing staff are a mess. They are very rude both in person and on the phone. What an awful experience.,Male
"If and when his totally incompetent, rude and uncaring nurse and staff get around to answering the phone, setting an appointment, or Checking on insurance- he appears to be a somewhat competent doctor. However- the chances of getting through his staff to get an appointment is slim and none. Horrible, awful, frustrating experience that extended for weeks. ",Male
"I don’t respect a doctors office that doesn’t try their hardest to help a patient. Especially since the doctor himself told the patient they didn’t have to worry about Rx until they found another doctor in their area.  The receptionist and nurse had no empathy. When told about the situation that probably didn’t even ask the doctor. 

So no I wouldn’t recommend this office, mainly do to front office staff and nurse.",Male
I don't know if my experience is typical but it took a month to get any information back on my sleep study.  Dr seems nice enough but this is the slowest doctor's office I have EVER been to.  It seems like they schedule ten people for your same appt time.  I waited for 45 or so minutes then I saw the doctor for about 1 minute so he could tell me I was fine.  I'm not sure why I even had to come in for that.,Male
He's very patient and caring. Very impressed. Was referred by a nurse friend of mine. Glad I came here. ,Male
I am very happy with the care that I have received from Dr. Yacoub.  He is open straight forward and honest.,Male
"Fantastic Doctor, very caring, personal, compassionate, intelligent.
Has been my doctor 10 years, I will not change doctors he is superb.",Male
"I've been seeing him for over 10 years and now think it's time to find a new Doctor. He Interrupts when you're speaking. Does not believe in a lot mental health ailments. Rushes patience through appointments and is not very attentive. Very nice man, but not the best option for my health unfortunately.",Male
"Dr. Yacoub is very caring doctor, he always follow up after test to let you know my result and what is next step he is going to take for treatment and explain why and answer all questions I have. 
He always replay to my email and one time he called me to make an appointment to see him due to high level on my blood test.
",Male
"Excellent doctor very caring and attentive to his patient needs, and that’s what people are looking for a doctor that care about their needs and not about the money, because right about now most doctors are playing politics with people conditions and lives so you have to find a doctor that cares  for your needs and he is that Doctor!!!!",Male
Dr Yacoub is thorough and explains carefully what his diagnosis is and what options there are for treatment. He is concerned and upbeat.,Male
Dr. Yacoub is possibly the best doctor I have ever visited. He listens attentively and answers all questions in terms I can understand. He makes sure one understands one's health issues before the appointment ends so one understands fully one's situation before leaving the office. I totally recommend Dr. Yacoub and his staff.,Male
"Dr. Yacoub is a pleasant surprise in the Austin area. He is always dedicated and will spend time explaining his decisions and health issues. Wait times are worse than other doctors I have seen in Austin--I usually have to plan for an extra 30 minutes, but his attentiveness makes up for it. I would give the overall experience 4.5 stars, compared to others in Austin.",Male
"Dr. Yacoub is awesome; to the point, clear explanations and passionate about your well-being.",Male
"IN ALL FAIRNESS I HAVE HAD YACOUB FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I MUST SAY HE IN NOT TO BE TRUSTED,I HAVE A HERNIA THAT IS GOING TO KILL ME AS IT IS STARTING TO STRANGULATE ME FROM THAT I WILL DIE.I HAD SERGURY SET UP THREE TIMES AN THE NITE BEFORE EACH TIME HE CANCELED IT HE IS VIOLATEING- MY RIGHT -TO GET MEDICAL HELP THAT MIGHT GIVE ME A BETTER LIFE.. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO DO THAT. AND TOMORROW I WILL CANCEL MY ACCOUNT WITH YACOUB AND SEEK ANOTHER DR.,THEN I WILL SEEK PROFESSIONAL WITH THIS MATER.",Male
"My elderly father lives an hour away and he and my mother were hit by another car within 5 minutes of Dr. Yacoub's office today.  They called his office and informed them of their circumstances.  When the police finished taking the report, my mother called his office back and was informed that they would have to reschedule because they were 45 minutes late. Now my parents had to drive an hour home after a car accident, only to drive back in two weeks.  Shouldn't doctors care about you?! Awful!",Male
The scare is extremely wonky. I have tried my thong on and had to pull it higher than usual. I will let the clinic know but already feel there going to tell me to wait a year to see the outcome. I’ve gone though so much pain and the thought of having a botched job and 2370 outbof pocket is upsetting.,Male
"""I had liposuction 4 areas and fat transfer 
As I’m writing this review I am still stuck in Tunisia but by the grace of god will be leaving tmr. I arrived in Tunisia on the 3/11/17 and had surgery done on the 4/11/17. When I arrived at the hospital the consultation that I had was less that a couple of minutes then I was rushed off to surgery. This company was more concerned about taking payment than any questions I had further more I was not even provided with the phone to call home as promised.",Male

Today I went back to Dr Mounzer and he was so nasty with me .the other doctor asked him to send my medical record and his huge ego doesn't accept it.

"I went for a basic check up and blood test to check my cholesterol. He noticed that my voice sounded rough which I thought  was normal since I was nearing 60. He said no and had a specialist check me. Well they found a tumor sitting above my vocal cords and narrowing my air way. I had no idea, but Dr. new something wasn't right. If it weren't for him I may have completely lost my voice if the tumor grew into the ends of my vocal cords. Also another time I  caught what I thought was pink eye and went in for a visit for some medical eye drops. He checked me out and said it was more serious then pink eye. He said to go to emergency. I went and they said it was pink eye. I went back to Dr Yacoub and reported what they said and he said no way. He immediately got me into an eye specialist and they found I had uveitis with severe inflammation which was causing my eye to turn blood red. Again he knew better then the emergency unit and had my well being his top priority which I am grateful for.",Male

"Dr. Yacoub is fabulous. He is not intimidated by any research you have done regarding your condition or questions about new medications that are being prescribed. He listens.

"I give Dr. Yacoub my full recommendation. I struggled with other doctors who could not help me. I got used to not being listened to and moving on to another doctor. Dr. Yacoub always listens. He looks at the labs then listens to my symptoms. If my numbers are good, but I'm still having symptoms, he keeps on adjusting until the labs are good and symptoms have subsided. He's warm and caring and an expert in his field. I don't know what I would do without his help.",Male

Every time I call the pharmacy my scripts are not there, they don’t even call it in until I call and complain! The girls there half the time are not even working, they would be conversing amongst each other and joking around! The doctor does not even know how to treat his patients!

"I went through three doctors, three misdiagnosis, and four months of pain and inconvenience until I met Dr. Shahan Yacoubian.  He gets my highest recommendation.  I wound up with a partial knee reconstruction and three months later I was completely recovered with a full range of motion.

Before the operation, I asked Dr. Yacoubian whether he was going to do a partial or full reconstruction and he said, ""I am going to have to go in and look. I do whatever is in the best interest of the patient.""  I definitely have the feeling that is what he always does.  If you want to save yourself a lot time go directly to Dr. Yacoubian.",Male
"I have had two total knee replacements with Dr. Yacoubian.  First one on Feb 1st 2020 and second one on Sept 1st 2020.

"It is 6 months since my complete hip replacement by Dr. Shahan Yacoubian honestly gave me my life back.  Fear of surgery, and anesthesia kept me from even making an appointment.  But finally,  I could not walk without the support of a cane and was never without pain, so I made the appointment.  I have never been more please with a physician and a practice.  All of my questions were answered completely and with understanding.  EVERY single person who was part of my care both at the OSS practice and Providence St. Joseph were caring and supportive. Now, 6 moths later, I walk every day with not limp and no pain.  My kids even stated that it was ""weird to see  Mom standing up straight and walking!""  This week, I even rode a bike.
Dr. Yacoubian told me at one of my first appointments that I would only say that I wish I had done this sooner once the surgery was done.  He was 100% right. Don't let fear get in the way of a pain free life.",Male
"Bi-lateral Total Knee Replacements

Dr. Shahan Yacoubian replaced both my knees in two separate operations, about five months apart.  Best decision I ever made. Unbearable pain eliminated 100 percent.  Without the replacements I would be in a wheelchair now instead of enjoying all my normal activities, including Pilates.  Okay, I did give up yoga but I already lost it when I could no longer kneel without agony.  I will tell you the rehab is crucial but it doesn't remotely compare in difficulty or pain with what I was dealing with before.  And I tried every alternative out there before resorting to surgery.  My only regret is waiting so many years for the real fix.  Now it's been five years and I still feel great.  Even the scars are minimal now.  You can't do better than Dr. Y for expert explanations,  talent as a surgeon, bedside manner and follow-up care.  I know it's scary, but it is SO worth it.  Go get your life back!",Male

Dr. Yacoubian saw me on short notice and performed both surgeries perfectly. He and his wonderful staff helped me through a long and difficult recovery time.

"My parents are patients for this doctor. He is very rude and the other day he treated my mother with disrespect. She's a stroke survivor she came home crying and her blood pressure was very high and was having anxiety. He grabbed her by her arm started pulling her by saying to get out and never come back, just because he wanted to do an ultra soundof her leg which he had done a month ago and my mother refused it.

"Dr. Yadack now practices in Oklahoma City.

"He did a simple procedure on my 81 year old mother and put her under verced. She had a instant reaction to it and coded on table. She died, her heart stopped. He brought her back, she was on life support for 24 hours. He is a quack. DO NOT LET HIM NEAR YOU.

"Dr. Yadala has been my neurologist for over a year.  She has tried several times to change my medication.  According to the doctor who did my brain surgery in another state, I'm only supposed to have brand name seizure meds.  She can't get that right, or department too ineffective to do paperwork.  Communication with neurology clinic is beyond sub-par, especially for a hospital that size. 

I have gone into status seizures TWICE this month.  This office does not seem to be concerned.  I can't even get Ativan to help control breakout seizures.  It can take days for her office to call me back.  UAMS, her practicing hospital, has set me up with new doctor, but not concerned enough with my health after ER visits to bump up my new doctor visit.  Pathetic. I've just about given up.  Go somewhere else.",Female
"I have been seeing Dr. Yadalla for 7 months and after my most recent experience I will never return. My appointment was at 10:30 i was finally taken back to the room at 12:10 and she came in at 12:20. It was just to review result of a recent procedure (which were negative and should have been handled with a phone call). During the 8 minutes she spent with me she recommended I go on birth control ( which I have been for 8 YEARS) and then said, okay, see you on your next annual.",Female

"I have the utmost  respect for Dr. Yadalla. My 2 daughters are also her patients. She is professional, caring, and  smart. I would highly recommend her!",Female
"She is patient, patient oriented, does not practice what I call 'cook book treatment' meaning she does not have a 'one size fits all' approach to care. She finds solutions that apply to your specific condition and lifestyle. I would recommend her to anyone who needs a caring, patient doctor. ",Female
"I have gone to the same gp for over 30 years. Since I moved it has been harder to travel up north for appts. I went to Dr Yadalla reluctantly but had a wonderful experience.

"I went to Dr. Yadao multiple times over a 6 to 9 month period of time for frozen shoulder which resulted in a successful shoulder manipulation.

I am completely recovered from a chipped ankle bone and fractured wrist. Less than two weeks ago, she performed a left knee arthroscopy, meniscectomy and chondroplasty.  I am currently in physical therapy, but even the therapist said I may not need many more visits.  I felt less pain in my knee immediately follow",Female
I was looking for an orthopedic specialist for my wife to have someone take a look at her fractured hand.  I found Dr. Yadao based on reviews and her credentials on our insurance’s website.  She was unprofessional and uncaring.  She has a snarky attitude to my wife and to her assistants.  We had to get my wife’s hand cast refitted three times with two visits. My wife didn’t expect any special treatment or any pampering because of her injury.  All she wanted was some professionalism and humility.,Female
"Unlike most of the reviews I see here that are based on perceived wait times and links of visit, I have actually been treated by Dr. Yadao. She actually did a surgical procedure on my knee and I cannot speak more highly of her and the care she provided. So you can pay attention to people that complain about having to wait for her  in a waiting room and then somehow expect her to spend 30 minutes with them as a patient, or you can pay attention to an actual patient of hers. She’s fantastic.",Female

"Dr, Yadao has been treating my kness for over a year now.  I first saw her at the Medstar Propt care facilty for a broken toe, which she took care of with minimal pain and great fresults.  I had had surgery o n one knee, but it was still hurting a lot.  I do not want to replace the knee just yet and she has been treating it with Monovisc injections.  She listened to me and we developed the treatment plan together.  I am very happy to have such a kind and effective doctor.",Female
"Dr. Melissa Yadao is by far the most unprofessional doctor I've had the displeasure of seeing.  I hurt my knee and was referred to her by my primary doctor.  She didn’t even exam my leg and sent me for a x-ray on my back; there was nothing wrong with my back.  Dr. Yado has a horrendous bed side manner, she is rude and uncaring.   After spending over 45 minutes waiting to see her, she spent less than  5 minutes with me.   I asked my primary doctor for another referral to a different doctor.",Female
"Dr. Yadao is taking the brunt for her practice’s asinine policies and her unwillingness to work with patients after a screw up on her practice’s part. 

Do not go to Greater Metro Ortho. You can only see one doctor..ever. New issue? Nope, you’ll only see the one doctor. 

I spoke with someone who was willing to try and work. After getting permission to allow me to be seen by Dr. Yadao, she refused to see me at a time convenient to me despite an open afternoon. 

Go elsewhere!",Female
She was amazing.  She was helpful and thorough with me about what needed to be done.,Female
"Aside from being an incredible surgeon, Dr. Yahao has a unique approach to her exam.  She always comes up with a strategy:  She makes sure you understand the problem, she describes the option available, and then talks through what she recommends and what the patient needs to do to resolve the problem.  I always leave here exams with a good feeling that I know what track I'm on and how I'm going to get better.  She is smart, organized and totally thorough which gives the patient confidence.",Female
The 5 min session was not worth my out of pocket payment of $185 where she basically pushed on the responsibility to a physical therapist. This made no sense considering an orthopedic physical therapist who was treating me suggested I see a doctor.,Female
"One star is too much. Dr Yadao and her staff are not worth your insurance and/or out of pocket money. Save it for another doctor. IF they are prompt in getting you checked in and walking you back to the room, you spend another hour in your exam room waiting for Dr Yadao to come and inspect you. My followup visit took an hour and half of wait time ALONE in my exam room before Dr Yadao came. It was a non-busy weekday morning! The portion of the actual doctor visit was &lt;10 min. Go somewhere else.",Female
"Dr. Yadao spends less than 10 minutes of every paid session with you. It's really like 5 or 6. it almost felt like a set of passing motions, in order to qualify it as a session. 

I felt rushed in and out of sessions. Her rhetoric is Hi. How are you? Feel pain? Where? No? OK, Take care! .

Dr. Yadao seemed very judgmental and the pretentiousness shows through her attitude. She makes it sound as if nothing is wrong with you at all, yet she schedules more sessions. I feel used.",Female
"Does not grasp communication skills between child and parent.
Lacks understanding in general. Not very alert or oriented ",Male
Kind caring and resourceful - truly gives you faith in modern day providers ,Female
Dr. Yadathi actually listens and takes the time to help you with your medical concerns. She truly cares and I am glad to have found her.,Female
"Dr. Yadati is the best doctor. He is kind. Listens and Offers advice. For the last year, since becoming the head of medicine for the Elliot, have had to deal with half wits who literally look in books in an attempt to change my meds. I miss Dr. Yadati terribly",Male
"I was a patient of Dr. Yadati's for approximately three years. He is very kind, however, seemed somewhat disengaged. Also important to note that he is not culturally competent in the area of LGBT+ patients, and engaged in problematic medical record keeping in relation to my gender transition. If you are fairly uncomplicated, straight, and not transgender - he would be fine for you.",Male
"Dr Yadav is amazing!
I received treatment from him, while I was experiencing an Anaphylactic shock. Dr Ayav made me feel very calm like I was in good care and magically made the experience rather pleasant, due to being both very competent as well as being charming. 10 out of 10 would recommend him for all your emergency care.",Male
"INCREDIBLE doctor. I presented in the ER to Dr. Yadav after receiving no treatment for seizures at 3 different ER's in the past week. Not only is he kind, patient, humble, and trustworthy, but he is highly competent. He prescribed me a medication that completely demolished my seizures. Something 6 other medical professionals misdiagnosed and neglected to treat me for. This is the only ER I will ever consent to go to in the state of Texas due to the care I received from Dr. Yadav.",Male
A truly caring and great anesthesiologist. He is very through and takes the time to make sure he knows everything that will help the patient have the best outcome. He has been the anesthesiologist for several procedures in the past year for my sister who is a challenging patient to intubate and everything went perfectly every time. Thank you Dr Yadav!,Male
"Dr. Anil Yadav is a competent and caring practitioner.  I would definitely recommend him.  I have been a patient of his for over five years.

His staff, on the other hand, can be very difficult to work with.  Questions referred to the nurse line will take a minimum of 72 hours.  I called, recently, with a question and did not hear back until two weeks later.  I called at least three times.  The question pertained to an otc that he had recommended at my last visit.  I simply couldn't recall the name.

This week, I realized that I was out of my medication, so I called the pharmacy.  They told me that they had already sent an electronic request to the doctor. When I didn't hear back, I called them again and they still hadn't heard from the doctor.  I called the doctor and they took a message.  This is day three and I've made multiple calls to the Jasper and Holly Springs office.  I am told that the message is in the doctor's ""box"" and they have no control as to when it will be taken care",Male
"I have been using this facility for about ten years and have had a great experience.  Appoints are on time.  Amy Mitton is the best, she is always friendly and smiling.  The front desk is friendly and helpful.
Thank you",Male
"We couldn't be happier with our choice.  His Canton office is in the new Northside Cherokee Hospital so the office is new, beautiful and super clean.  All his staff are pleasant, knowledgeable  and responsive.  There are little or no wait times.  Dr. Yadav is very friendly, pleasant and accurate in his diagnosis.  He explains everything in a very understandable way and is willing to answer lots of questions never making us feel rushed. Highly, highly recommend!",Male
Dr. Yadav and his staff are awesome. All are kind and courteous. Kim always takes good care of me! ,Male
"Dr Yadav and his staff at Prestige Medical Group Jasper, GA are amazing.  They are truly interested in my health and well being. Dr Yadav was instrumental in guiding me back to health after being diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with my health and well being. ",Male
"I have been a patient of Dr. Anil Yadav for six years and have found him to be thorough and knowledgeable in the care he has provided for me. He listens carefully to my questions and answers in terms that are easily understood.
I would recommend Dr. Yadav and his colleagues to friends and family.",Male
"My daughter and I love going to Prestige Medical Group. Everyone is so pleasant, from the front office to the nurses and doctors.  The nurses and doctors explain everything that is being done. My daughter has a fear of doctors, but she loves seeing the doctors and NP's here. ",Male
"My husband and I are both patients of Dr. Yadav. We visit his office in Jasper, Georgia. It is Prestige Primary Care. He is extremely knowledgeable and professional. He always treats me with respect and is genuinely concerned with my overall well being and health. We would highly recommend him to all of our friends and family. Jasper is extremely lucky to have Dr. Yadav and his group in their town. ",Male
"Dr. Yadiv has been my primary care physician for over six (6) years now.  I find him to be very personable, professional, knowledgeable and thorough.  I'm glad to call him my doctor and  refer him to friends whenever given the chance.",Male
Always able to get in quickly.  Staff is wonderful and takes great care of me.  They are the best! ,Male
"She listens,  she's professional but also down to earth and easy to talk with. She's also concerned, caring and knowledgeable.",Female
"Dr. Yadav took plenty time explaining procedure.  People working for her are polite and knowledgeable.  Were rules about driver to take me home as I would be under general anesthetic during procedure.  Due to my cancer and meds I take for that, she felt more comfortable doing colonoscopy in hospital.  Due to my insurance this was not problem for me and I appreciated extra care.

Reason she didn’t get 5 stars:  this was our first meeting and I don’t give 5 stars to anyone but Hem/Onc.",Female
"Dr Yadav is not a Dr. I would recommend.  He practices family medicine, however, does a poor job managing chronic conditions.  I am in the process of finding a new Dr. to manage my husband's  chronic care.  He doesn't make sense in his decisioning.",Male
"After seeing many doctors begging for help I was referred to Dr. Yadav. While he took extra time in the 1st visit he kept reminding me of it stating ""I hope you appreciate the time I'm taking for you."" In the first visit my every effort and discussion to figure out what was wrong with me was quickly dismissed &amp; I was told ""I may not be able to figure it out"" &amp; ""some people just have to live on liquids."" I first visited him months ago with tests completed &amp; not a single medication called in to help me. I get test results today &amp; expect to hear again there is nothing he can do for me. With all his years experience, &amp; all the testing and meds available this just isnt an acceptable answer. After my gallbladder was removed years ago my symptoms worsened now leaving me at one meal a day &amp; now I'm at the point that acid comes up in my throat all night leaving me with no sleep. I get nauseous every time I ea &amp; I have painful esophageal spasms every day. I can't take the suffering anymore.",Male
"During this 1st appointment, Dr Zaacks was very profession and took a lot of time to listen to me and to  get my medical history. She did a thorough examination and I was left with an understanding of my treatment plan and her recommendations on medications. I have a lot of confidence in her and would give her my highest recommendations.",Female
"The best doctor in my life. Dr. Zaacks is very knowledgeable, caring and patient. You can trust her completely. In the time of crises she is very responsive and helpful.",Female
very caring and understanding.  listens to what you have problems and addresses them in a way you can understand  i have all the trust in the world of her,Female
she takes time with her patients. ,Female
Wonderful wonderful doctor!   I was 99% occluded and needed stents and other stuff.  He kept me alive.  Thank you,Male
"I would never recommend Steven Zaacks to ANYBODY!! After seeing me for three years and completely ignoring my symptons, I switched to a REAL DOCTOR and had extensive open-heart surgery almost immediately. Zaacks totally ignored torn cordae tendonae of my mitral valve. He should be digging ditches, not treating people.",Male
"The staff called 15 minutes before my appoint and stated the Dr. Could not see me because I did not have a referral.  They did not call my doctor and I was referred by the emergency room from the day before as I was there with massive chest pains.  The staff was not helpful in any way at all.  I called my doctor and she was going to send the referral immediately.  I opted to wait till tomorrow and see a different cardiologist at another hospital, because to poor quality and urgency they had. Boo",Male
Extremely rude to me before surgery.  Didn't answer any of my questions.  When I woke up was throwing up and coughing and I was hoarse weeks after the surgery (I called to make an appt to see if he will check if this is an anesthesia complication but despite several messages no call back),Male
"Very knowledgeable, compassionate, great bed-side manner, and funny! No nausea after surgery and excellent personal follow up. I will always request him",Male
"Been a patient of Dr Zaagers for 10 yrs &amp; my son 
2 yrs . Within last yr issues with referrals not happening - appt availability &amp; very long office wait times &amp; percriptions being handled improperly.
Still remained - however their recent handling of clearance for sons surgery was horrible . We were told papers would be completed in 4 days - took 2 weeks due to their incompentance &amp; lack of followup for blood work , worse was their total lack of respect for us &amp; adding unnecessary stress.",Male
Dr Zaager is absolutely hands down the most amazing physician . He spends as much time as needed with you. he is extremely knowledgeable. 16 doctors could not figure out what  was wrong with me. Dr Zaager knew what it was in the first ten minutes of speaking with him,Male
"Amazing doctor . Love his new staff. They are an asset to the office . Extremely pleasant and always helpful
. Doctor Zaager is the only doctor it seems that will not rush you . He listens . If you come in with a list of questions he not only answers then but , makes sure you understand . He treats you as a whole person unlike most office that make you feel like you are just a dollar sign to be rushed out the door. He’s compassionate and caring . He’s an excellent diagnostician . ",Male
"By far the best obgyn I have had. She has a great demeanor, she is understanding, and she is the only gynecologist I want to go to as long as I live in the PDX metro.",Female
"Bad surgical technique, not thorough, poor communication and non-existent follow-up. Had procedure done by her and her team with many complications post surgery. I have had to see three doctors to get her work corrected. Don't risk your health, time or money.",Female
"I never leave reviews.  But wow, Dr Zaander and the other women in the office are absolutely wonderful! I have never felt so comfortable and well taken care of by a doctor.  The only reason I didn't want to leave a review is because I don't want the office to get too busy! ",Female
"She is very informative, professional, and kind. I had an IUD placed and though the procedure is inherently uncomfortable, she worked efficiently and smoothly to decrease my discomfort as much as possible. I very appreciate her work.",Female
"His office left my daughter without any anti seizure medication by not simply returning a call to our pharmacy or faxing over a simple letter they needed. 

He never examines a patient and only looks to use medications in a trial and error form of hoping to help the patient.

Disgraceful.",Male
I saw Doctor Megdad Zaatreh - Epileptologist - NJ - at CentraState Healthcare System -it was the best Dr I was examined by. He knew exactly how to treat my condition. He was patient with me &amp; always made himself available to any urgent calls that were made to him by myself or family members. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHYSICIAN. I trust him with my life.   ,Male
Very thorough and caring. Gives you the time and touches on all the necessary points to ease your concerns. ,Female
Called to see about a refill (they have been extremely nice in the past on CALLING ME telling me about my refill) . No sir Mr.(my last name) We can not refill your meds because u haven't been here in 2 years??(that's because I had a upper and lower check) and no reason to go back for 5 years? It is a reflux med I take on a regular bases and have for years. I had the pharmacy call and my rx went thru.I am totally confused  WHY??,Male

"I have been a patient of Dr. Zabad for over 15 years.  He is an awesome doctor. He is relentless in that he will find out what ails you!  He sent me to many GI doctors that gave up on me. He finally found one that knew what was wrong. Dr. Zabad saved my life! Thanks for never giving up, Dr. Zabad!",Male
"very self centered -she should have taken a career in debating-belittled my son-she needs to be reminded she is a doctor,not a district attorney----she forgets that unmc is a state funded hospital,and needs to learn to show compassion and understanding-instead of rushing to judgment-my son had an appointment may 24th-and she would not she him until june 19th-when she had the results she needed much sooner-very cruel and inhumane-and she brings in a nurse for the second visit as a witness 2 cover",Female
Always extremely supportive.  Has managed my MS for 5-6 years now and the difference in care I've received since transferring under care has been very good.  During the 23 years of living with MS she explains changes that I'm going through thoroughly and takes the time to answer my questions and concerns.,Female

Dr George Zabaneh is a wonderful dr. He takes his time to heart what you have to say. He ordered any test that he thinks is necessary. He had the best bedside manner. His staff are very helpful and will go out of their way to make sure they accommodate you. Perfect doctor. Please educate yourself on his role when you are in the hospital. They have a hospitalist come see you so don’t leave negative reviews. He is wonderful and I will recommend him. My parents also see dr. George. He is the best.,Male

Very late ,Male
Dr. Zabat and all of the staff were great.  The wall thermostat was reading 82 Deg F when I walked into the office and it felt like 90.

"We were recommended to Dr Zabat for an injury my son sustained played team sports.

Was told by the receptionist that they have early morning appointments starting at 6am. I arrived Monday morning at 6am promptly and the receptionist scanned my BCBS insurance card and proceed to tell me that all visits require a $40 co pay and that ANY procedure is going to be $150 out of pocket.  I then waited 15 minutes to be shown into an exam room and then another 15 minutes before I walked out and asked for my paperwork back. Who makes a new client wait a 1/2 hr to see the Dr? Go elsewhere,Male
"Best dermatologist I have found.  Suffered for years with skin rashes.  Went everywhere to find a 
cure.  Little did I know that Dr. Ed was right here in my hometown and was the only one that helped 
me.  I am rash free after only a month of treatment.  
Thank you isn't even enough to say how grateful I am for his expertise and his wonderful bedside manner.",Male
Dr. Gallegos is the best pediatrician. She always takes her time when checking my girls specially my little one who has asthma and tends to develop bronchitis &amp; pneumonia. She is always a step ahead of everything and everyone. My girls absolutely love her. She is very calm and she makes the kids trust her. Also scheduling is simple and quick specially for sick visits the same day. I absolutely recomment her.,Female
Not the best doctor. Office staff is also part of the issue,Female
"All the above sound about right - if Jean even allows you to speak to dr, then they both gang up negatively. I make my kids appts  and they don’t like  that. Jean will re-call my kids, not me and make a remark to them about mommy making calls.   One appt, I asked for help and  I was told, that’s life today, get used to it.   Very judgmental and never hear what you have to say. Desperately need a new dr.",Female
"Do not use this person as your physician.  Her bedside manner, lack of compassion and lack of empathy toward her patients is unmatched.  She could care less about your medical condition.  She doesn't listen to her patients explain their problem, she talks over you, she will not converse with the patient and generally seems to lack necessary medical knowledge.  I wouldn't trust her to care for my nieces dolls much rather a living family member.   Save yourself the time of coming here and choose a ""real doctor"" that is interested in caring for patients not insulting and upsetting them while concurrently doing nothing to treat even the simplest medical conditions.  Her office is dirty, it smelled of urine and her office staff is just as miserable and difficult to deal with as she.  Stay away from this practice.  She should not be allowed to interact with patients or any type of human and neither should her staff.  I don't think the office itself has been cleaned in over a decade.",Female
"You never know whether you are going to get the pleasant Dr. Zabel or the miserable abrupt one who rushes you out of the office. Her assistant is not much better, always in a hurry and flustered.",Female
"Dr. Zabel always makes time to listen to your concerns and answer all questions.
I trust everything she says and so far, she has always been right!",Female
"I have visited many doctors in my lifetime and more than not, the encounters were positive. However, my recent visit with Dr. Zabel is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I was so taken back by her demeanor, I did not know how to proceed with the conversation. She was abrupt, condescending, and appeared to have little interest in the patient. I understand the doctors have a right to get frustrated with their patients, especially if they don't always comply, however that is no excuse.",Female
"I am a long time patient of Dr. Zabel.  I trust her completely and have found her to be caring, informative and clearly concerned with my health.  She is a master at diagnosing any illness and always makes time to answer fully any questions. ",Female
Fantastic - very caring and willing to make me happy with my breast reconstruction.,Male
"Dr. Zabel is a very kind physician. He explained my procedure thoroughly and what to expect through the entire process.  His office staff is very helpful, kind and patient.  I would highly recommend Dr. Zabel for any procedure.",Male
He's the first surgeon I've met that was not there to give me a run down of how the procedure went when I woke up.  He took on my case which perhaps he should have referred out to someone with more experience.  Went elsewhere for follow up care and the revisions that I need.  Very arrogant and condescending.  Would not recommend.,Male
"Many people may look to Dr. Zabel for plastic surgery, but I actually saw him for wound care.  His innovative approach to correcting the wound actually resolved my nerve pain allowing me to get off of major opioids.  No other doctor would have done this for me and I are eternally grateful for my quality of life returning.  I have 100% trust in him and will return to him for any future needs.   The wait time was average for specialty doctors and the staff is fantastic.",Male
I had an excellent experience with this surgeon. Doctor &amp; his staff were accommodating &amp; professional over a 6 month period that I was under his care. I had a fantastic outcome &amp; would highly recommend this practice.,Male
"He was very thorough in explaining exactly what he was going to do.....he took  time to answer my questions......It was an excellent meeting.

He talked plain to me and I would recommend him to friends.,Male
Kind and thoughtful. Takes time to listen and understand patient's needs. Great cardiologist!,Male
"I had a routine screening with Dr. Zabel June 25 and was disappointed to see that the staff did not wear masks.  When inquiring about it, I was told that masks were optional and the clinic had opted not to wear them.  I am over 70 years old, and quite frankly, I didn't feel safe  in the clinic.  Mask wearing  is recommended as one of the ways to prevent Covid19 transmission and I would think that a dermatology clinic would embrace all of the recommendations to provide safety for their patients.  The monitor that runs continuously in the reception area says that masks are being worn when they are not.  The monitor should be turned off if the message it is sending is not the same as what the clinic is practicing.  I hope that Dr. Zabel will rethink his decision to make masks optional for his staff and his patients.",Male
Dr Zabel answered all my questions and concerns about my procedure for skin cancer. He did a great job and was respectful and professional. His staff is friendly and caring.,Male
"Dr Zabel is the best.  He is very professional, listens and always explains what treatments are needed and what options are available.  I always feel my care is in good hands.  His staff is also very courteous and helpful.",Male

"Listens attentively, has a great sense of humor, puts you at ease right away and thoroughly addresses any questions or concerns you may have. Explains all options available and makes recommendations as to what he suggests would be most effective in each case, but will work with patient to make final decision.

At first I had no expectations, like I said before I’d been to several other Drs, but then I started seeing results.  Today my keloid is gone, and I am elated.

"The impression of total incomprehension on the part of the doctor and 
misdiagnosing all the time. The other people and friends say this doctor
does a good routine job of cleaning various skin growths, the question is
if this is sufficient to have the title of MD...",Female
Never again. Waiting time 3 hours. Very unprofessional doctor.,Female

Worst doctor I have ever seen. Office staff is horrible. Never submitted my paperwork to insurance. Never answer the phones. Dr has the worst bedside manner. ,Male
Dr. Zabiega is an excellent Neurologist.  It is the clinic that doesn't know how to manage patients.  The care I receive from him is why I put up with it.  My health is more important than the clinic issues. ,Male

Poor survice . Never coming here again ,Male
"His receptionist is TERRIBLE!
I called asking for help in getting an MRI scheduled, she refused to help me.
Thankfully the hospital took care of it :)
Today, one day before the MRI, the hospital said they have tried repeatedly calling his office to get authorization and they cannot get a hold of them.
So I tried to call the office. The receptionist was quite rude and said the hospital never called annd I need to call them back and take care of it.
She is too busy!
I thought that would be her job",Male
Dr. Zabielinski is absolutely amazing! I like to try out new dermatologists every now and then for comparison to ensure I am going to the best and was overwhelmingly surprised. I have finally found my permanent Derm!  She has a natural artistic eye for fillers and botox that I find others lack. She was also one of the smartest doc's I have ever met. She was able to correctly diagnose a condition that has been plaguing me for years and was missed by the other docs in town. ,Female
"Dr.Z is incredible. She is knowledgeable and thorough but also personable and genuinely kind. I highly recommended her for cosmetics, as well as for dermatologic issues.",Female

"Dr. Zabih is not just a regular physician , he is a true healer. I have never had better health care.",Male
The office staff are very unorganized.  I waited over 30 minutes before even being checked in for my appointment.,Male
Ive been going to Dr. Zabih for about 13 years.  I moved from the beach to the country (55 miles) 4 years ago.  I still drive that 55 miles because Ive become friends with Dr. Zabih and only trust him for being my primary care physician.,Male
"Very caring, listens, very knowledgeable and not long wait times. Staff is friendly, a little difficulty with staff follow thru on tests, messages, feedback, but is a great Dr. who is compassionate and kind.",Male
I've been in his care for almost 10 years now. He maintains a busy office and still gives personal attention to each of his patients. I literally trusted this man with my life while battling Lung Cancer. His care made during this crisis will never be forgotten. He holds a special place in my heart. It's why I stayed with him all these years. From eastern Bay County to the west end of Panama City Beach because he's worth the trek.,Male
"I have been under Dr. Zabih's fantastic care for over 9 years.  He has taken good care of me.  I trust him.  He is caring and compassionate and never hurries through a visit.  He answers my questions, no matter how many, and has never failed to guide me in the right direction with - if needed - the best medication or physical therapy.",Male
Always spot on in Dignoses and great bedside manner.,Male
"A team of Angels. Caring and treating with warmth, sympathy, and understanding. God bless Dr.Zabih and his team of Angels!

Thank you so much for all your hard work Dr.Zabih.  we love all the people who work in your office  they are awesome.  Just saying. David  Hall.",Male
"I was very disappointed because Kaiser Permanente has excellent doctors.

Doctor is late for appointments and surgery-not respectful of patient's time. Does not listen effectively and sympathetically to patient's questions and dismissive about patient's concerns. It seems like doctor is always pressed for time and distracted by her own agenda of what she wants to do. I trusted her advice regarding surgery and now, I am regretting trusting her recommendations. I hope she can change and improve.",Female
"My experience was exceptional,professional  sensitive and supportive.I recommend her and the staff .",Female
She is very good. She answers all questions that are asked of her in a very positive way.,Female
She's rude! She belittles nursing staff and she is not clear when explaining things. The patient and family were left clueless after she came in to discuss the plan of care for the day.  They seemed pretty dissatisfied with her. ,Female
Dismissive attitude,Female
I don’t know if he’s a good doctor or not but I can tell you from experience he has a teenagers as Billing manager And she in a childish way  try to rip you off you don’t take my word go for a visit and if you need a colonoscopy you will told you will receive a call 24 hours in advance Of your procedure from the medical center telling you how much they want you to pay in the morning when you go in and not until then you would know what your charge is just for the medical facility Charges and  not the doctor bill which they will not tell you if they have prequalified you or not even though they are in you insurance company network. This doctor needs to hire a more experienced and honest staff rather than a couple of teenagers on their first job.,Male
"I needed a kind, considerate and experienced doctor. I have found him. You will know it yourself.",Male
"TERRIBLE DOCTOR -  Stay away for families sake.
This guy is probably one of the worst doctors located in proximity to Mission Hospital.  He pushes off patients who actually need attention regardless of their medical state.   I have heard from countless doctors that he is only in it for money &amp; not for personal care.  In one of my examinations with him; He was confusing and frankly completely wrong with his diagnosis.   Thankfully I have gone to a new specialist and receiving much better care.  ",Male
This guy is a real piece of work. On my procedure day he  didn't even talk to me.....,Male
I was satisfied with his manner and explanation and received my results in reasonable time. Everything went as expected. no surprises. ,Male
This doctor is accurate and kind.he does not do unneccesary surgeries.very knowledgable and explains clearly.,Male
"excellent, knowledgeable and kind doctor. I recommend him.",Male
"I wouldn't recommend him, he is very restricted and followed  his books, he doesn't recognize everyone's metabolism is different than the others, he should not prescribe the same way even though the book said. Same prescription as before over and over again.",Male
"He graduated from Tehran-Iran university, he never listen to his patients and looks like Master &amp; Server, from old school. He screwed me up with too much steroids. Stay away from him and his receptionist.",Male
Dr. Zabilski did surgery on my broken ankle. He and the whole staff were wonderful. I recommend him very highly.,Male
"I saw Dr. Zabilski three times after a skiing injury which caused persistent knee swelling, pain while walking and going up and down steps, and tenderness along the MCL for the last 5 months.  After the 2nd visit, he sent me for physical therapy - during which the physical therapist noted that a ligament on the side of my knee was popping during some of the exercises. At that point they suggested I stop therapy and wait to see what the doc had to say.  On my third visit, Dr. Zabilski started interviewing me about my injury as though he had never treated me before - clearly he never bothered to review my charts, nor the PT notes in my medical record. When I reminded him that he had treated me before - he briefly read the notes from my prior office visit, but not any of the notes from PT (that I could tell).  After a brief exam of my knee, because my knee mobility had improve, he said that I could finish out PT and come back to see him ""if I wanted."" No thanks...I'll be going elsewhere.",Male
I wish I could give him negative 5 stars! He is a rude and incompetent doctor. I was hit by a truck while riding my bike and he couldn’t even figure out a very obvious injury. I went to an amazing chiropractor after him that figured out was was wrong in less than 30 minutes. My hip and spine were badly thrown out He is an arrogant dinosaur that doesn’t seem to understand that patients are paying him. I waited 40 minutes for him to give me less than 10 minutes. Talked to his scribe instead of me.,Male
"Dr. Zabilski performed a total hip replacement on me July 10th 2018. Prior to the surgery, for a year, I had been in debilitating pain in my right knee and hip. I did some pre surgery PT which I believe helped me in my recovery. 8 weeks since surgery I am back to playing golf full time and no longer have any pain whatsoever. I wholeheartedly  reccomend Dr. Joseph Zabilski. One of the best surgeons in the state of MA, if not the best. He operates out of Beth Israel  Plymouth, a great hospital.",Male
Dr. Zabilski has a very calming manner and is an extremely skilled orthopedic surgeon. He has made my total knee replacement experience less stressful and my recovery quicker as I was told exactly what to expect.,Male
"Dr. Zabilski performed emergency surgery on my crushed tibial plateau last week.  I am not from MA and was concerned about both the quality of care and surgical expertise since I couldn't do any research.  Although I'm less than a week from the surgery, I can say that so far recovery has exceeded my expectations.  Dr. Zabilski is informative and kind and, if post-op pain is any indication-excellent at his work.",Male
"Long wait for a very short exam. He was callous, aloof and insensitive. His recommendation for my knees sounded scripted and rushed. When I questioned his perspective - including notes from my PC - he ignored me. Advised physical therapy for an extremely swollen, painful knee. Told me to go buy a cane and knee brace and left the room. Next visit scheduled with a NP - I won't be going back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this doctor.",Male
"After waiting over an hr to see Dr. Zabilski, it was as if I was being rushed through so he could catch up.  Spent less than 5 minutes with him (excluding time for x-rays), and then recommended physical therapy for my hip.  After visiting a physical therapist twice, the pain I was experiencing was due to a back problem - not a hip problem as Dr. Zabilskie concluded. And the follow-up appt wasn't even going to be with the Dr., but an associate.  Cancelled the appt. and won't be going back.",Male
Attentive and Top Notch Care and Service. The entire team Doc to reception there to make your uncomfortable crisis as painless and seamless as possible!,Male
"Professional, quick, but thorough. Answered my questions and wasn't trying to run me through a lot of unnecessary tests.",Male
"I had partial kidney surgery 2016, I am not the same person. I can not do things I used to do. I was in the hospital for 4 months due to a partial nephrectomy that was a one day stay. I told the doctor when I came too I did not feel good.. Something was not right. He released me the next day. I said I do not feel good he said I checked out fine. I was back in the next day sick as a dog. Not in my right mind, had pneumonia, I was anemia heart rate 125, I had Sepsis, I had a perinephric abscess they had to drain my stomach, within the month needed 2 blood transfusions, had a right lung surgery.  ALL Due to Dr Zabinski surgery. Two months rehabilitation. Many hospital and Doctor bills too. That I should not have. Still owe about 7,000 dollars, after insurance. All this for an overnight one day surgery per Dr Zabinski. Easy Peasy as he said. 
Still not the same as I used to be before 2016. I get out of breath fast due to the lung surgery that was done due to messed up kidney surgery.",Male
"We are forever grateful to Dr. Zabinski. 
My husband's cancer was extensive &amp; advanced, as Dr. ""Z"" stated--he was behind the 8 ball with this one! Praise God, surgery went very well, and the 3-mo. PSA is 0! An added bonus is he is almost completely dry--which is the result of a skilled surgeon preserving the muscle that controls urination.  We appreciate his candor, &amp; especially his surgical skills, &amp; highly recommend him. We thank you Dr. Zabinski for saving my husband's life &amp; giving us hope.",Male
"Saved my life in 2012 by removing kidney tumor with no complications and virtually no pain,, and has monitored me closely since.  I've never had trouble getting answers to questions, but all I want to know is ""am I still okay?"".  I would highly recommend him for da vinci robotic surgery, though I find a couple of the other reviews troubling.... MY experience has been 100% positive.",Male
"His robotic surgery and practice of not prescribing antibiotics after surgery, infected and killed my wife! He has also infected several other patients. ",Male
Dr Zabinski is now independent and no longer at this facility.,Male
"Will not be missed, after partial kidney surgery 2 years ago, I am still not the same person. I can not do things I used to do.  Had to have lung surgery about a 2 weeks after my kidney surgery due to fluid leaking in my body.  Will not miss this doctor at all, but I do wish him all the luck in his future. He may have helped some people, just not me. He was in a hurry to get to his son’s birthday. I remember that day so well that is all he talked about.... His son’s birthday party that weekend.",Male
Dr. Andrew Zabinsky performed robotic surgery on me 5 years ago for kidne cancer and saved my life. He is a great guy and has monitored me closely since the surgery.,Male
Great surgical skills but lousy bedside manner!!!,Male
at 44 i was diagnoses with prostate cancer. Dr Zabinski immediately told me my options and setup a surgery. Within two weeks i was cancer free. He has been a great inspiration to keep on my journey without cancer. I would recommend it to anyone with my eyes close.,Male
5 years ago when this Dr did 150 surgeries with the robot. He remove my prostate and cut my bladder. Although he finally admitted what happened. He did little to help me. My bladder flowed 100% 24 hours a day. I lived in 10 diapers a day for 2 years. My reconstruction surgery is 90%. My life will never be the same. I felt I was not informed to all the risks. Patient beware. He's above his patiences in his mind. Wish their were negative stars as for my case he deserve a minus 5 stars.,Male
"Dr. Zabinski takes the time to listen and His concern for making you better is sincere. His staff is amazing, friendly and efficient.",Male
"Short wait, but there is almost always is a wait, but that is because he is the best and everyone wants the best.",Male
"I was having a complication related to a procedure which caused me to have acute urinary retention and subsequent incontinence. Not only did he fit me into  his busy practice rather quickly, but he was thorough, efficient and caring. He and his staff coordinated a comprehensive diagnostic work up within 1 hour. His office staff were responsive to my needs and questions. I left his office feeling heard, cared for, and knowledgeable about the next steps take to get better.",Male
"Dr Zabinsky did not seem to have read the patient records from previous doctor.  The patient is 87 years old, but the doctor recommended solutions that were long term like elastic hose.  With only a few years to live, all that was wanted was prostate removal, so night time urination would be less.  Doctor seemed to put this way in the future - just wanted to pee in a cup and do more tests. Patient does not want more tests and will probably not return - just get up five times a night.",Male
"I was amazed with providing service from all stuff members in those hard times because of Covid, everyone was very friendly, professional and helpfull,",Male
"Rushing to do surgery, instead of giving non surgical fair trail to the issue in the knee or extra.",Male
1st meeting with Dr Zabinski for a total knee replacement he gave me very detailed pre op instructions. His scheduling staff is on point. Testing done as per instructions and surgery scheduled no problems!  Surgery at Shore Surgery Center without a hitch.

He is a great communicator and also a brilliant surgeon!,Male
"The most arrogant man I have ever met.  Went to him for problem in my hip. He told me that my problem was not orthopedic. He never sent me for any test. I went to another orthopedic Dr. and he sent me for MRI and it turns out that I had a complete tear in hip and a orthopedic is the only person who can repair it. 

SHAME ON YOU Zabinski",Male

I had great results , walking with a cane in2 weeks , driving in 3 weeks ,back into my normal routine. Was a great experience, would recommend him to anyone .

"I went to see Dr. Zablow for a referral after I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  My Urologist does  laparoscopic surgery and sent me to Dr. Zablow so that I could learn about other options. The wait time was very short and Dr. Zablow greeted me with a hearty hello.

Dr. Zablow was very informative and gave me statistics on the various options without trying to steer me into any particular option. After talking to him I decided on seed therapy which he does not currently do and he readily gave me a referral to a very nice Doctor. I did not feel rushed at all and he must have asked me at least 5 times if I had any other questions. (which I appreciated) He also gave me his office email address so that I could continue to use him as a resource.

I would highly recommend Dr. Zablow as he gives kind, informative opinions.",Male

"It's very difficult to locate a IFM certified physician in WNY, so I searched outside the area and came upon Dr. Zablozki-Amir. I was so happy I made the trip to Brooklyn to her practice. The staff made appt. setting easy, they were all so friendly, and genuinely concerned with my health concerns.  Dr. Z spent close to 2 hours collecting information, suggesting testing, and I look forward to my follow up visit, to better understand some health issues and learn more about my personal wellness!",Female
"I wanted to try different methods of treating my joint pains.  I had some trouble signing in to the Medical Marijuana System, due to my own impatience, and vexations caused by computers, but by the end of the day Dr. Z and Evelyn had me up and running, she was there the answer every call, and email I received what I needed from the government in two day. I believe Dr. Z is a concerned provider, she helped me through a difficult time, a good listener, has a great manner, and an all around good e",Female
Worst infectious disease specialist ever,Female
The worst. Rude. Horrible bedside manner. Apathetic and not interested in well being of her patients.,Female
"Smart, personable, thorough.",Female

"I saw Dr. Zabo due to a pregnancy emergency. I was very upset and nervous, and he treated me with kindness. He was far more gentle and careful than many other doctors who've examined me in the past. I feel comfortable about returning to this hospital and giving birth, thanks to him and the nurses on duty.",Male
Terrible.  He is all over the place.  Can’t get a straight answer and not dependable.  Can’t figure out why he was hired.,Male
"Fantastic experience. Dr. Zaboli saw my son in the office. Very through and patient, explains things well. Nice bedside manner. Highly recommend. ",Male
"Horrible. Saw my child in the hospital and made several promises about care and treatment. totally left us hanging for hours and then had a resident come in and say there was a miscommunication and to follow up with him in his office instead. It wasn't a miscommunication - he blew my child off, changed his mind, got called home for dinner, I don't know, but we will never follow up with him. Horrible care. I couldn't even give him one star if that were an option.",Male
"Saw Dr. Zabolotsky for severe gastro intestinal symptoms and he told me, I would have to wait 3 months for endoscopy!! Ended up leaving his office and going to the ER!!",Male
Awesome ! Just awesome! ,Male

Dr Zaborsky has been my doctor at the Sebring VA Medical Clinic.  She has been most diligent and concerned for my needs.  I am very happy with her professional performance and would recommend her to anyone eles.,Female
Dr Zaborsky was shipped out of Florida into LA by the VA.  I had a bad experience because she failed to perform basic examinations during 2 separate appointments 6 months apart.,Female
Dr. Zaboski Is very careening and thoughtful doctor as I often ask for alternative medicine we always work and succeed. I have left the State and are unable to see him sadly. Best wishes to his practice,Male
Dr Zaboski is a great doctor. He is patient and really thorough to find out the best course of treatment. What he doesn’t know he will investigate to try and find a solution. ,Male
"Dr. Zaboski has taken care of my family for years. He is always thoughtful, kind and very knowledgeable. He explains in detail any concerns and makes sure that the medications that are prescribed are correct for you and continue to work correctly each year. The staff is excellent. From the front desk to nursing you feel that the office really cares about the patient.  ",Male
"Excellent Patient care manner.  Kind, considerate and VERY knowledgeable.  He takes time to answer all your questions and does NOT condescend. ",Male
"Curt, young/inexperienced &amp; parochial, not up to date with current research and not very knowledgeable with men's issues. Wrote erroneous info in my medical record that I saw her for diet &amp; nutrition advice, which is not the case nor needed. Can't answer simple questions, spoke with poor grammar. Amateur at best.",Female
"Not impressed, not a good listener, seems inexperienced in men's issues and tends to be curt. I got the impression she was out of her league and just wanted to get the visit over. Will be changing insurances and docs asap. I would not recommend.",Female
She is not a good doctor.,Female
"excellent listener, exceptional care",Female
"This doctor is a liar. She told patient that she couldnt give a cotisone shot due to liability reasons. Not sure what liability there is with a cortisone shot given at Kaiser. They give them all the time. Perhaps she doesnt know how to administer one? In which case you get a doctor that can do it, not lie to the patient and send the patient off with a bunch of drugs. Shame on you. I guess if you want a doctor that will prescribe you a bunch of hard drugs you dont need, go see this doctor.",Female
"Excellent at explaining VP Shunt procedure.  Great follow-up and excellent office staff, especially Veronica.",Male
He was very kind and understanding of my fear of surgery. He explained what was going to be done so I could understand. He did complete follow -ups!,Male
"Saved my life by an emergency craniectomy. I truly don't believe I'd be here today without this man. Not only amazing with his hands, he has wonderful bedside manner. Actually came out after one of my surgeries and placed his hand on my mom's hand and said ""it's going to be okay mom. She'll be okay"". He could have sent out a nurse but he wanted to be there for my family and me. Cannot say enough about Dr. Z",Male
"Saved my life 16 years ago. Excellent recovery. Dr. Z is number 1 in my book,",Male
"Dr. Zabrecky was definitely doctor intelligent but maybe lacked a little in the baby common sense dept, she said it’s been too long since she had an actual baby. I was also sent home from the hospital with major post c-section infections, so when I called her to explain that I felt something was def not right and that I had went through all my pain meds in one day she treated me as if maybe I had a drug problem and didn’t care. I ended up in the emergency room 10 minutes after talking to her.",Female
Dr. Zabrisikie was very easy going and comforting during my pregnancy.,Male
Told me that the condition I was dealing with was “all in my head” and sent me home. Luckily the next doctor I saw was willing to listen and help me. ,Female
"Love her
She delivered all 3 of my children and I recommend her to everyone.

I researched extensively before selecting my doctor.   With out fail everyone said  she was the doctor to see. .  My deliveries each held challenge's and she was caring throughout the care before, during, and after delivery.  

Amazing sums her up for me",Female
"Very Bad.Poor knowledge on subject matter, confused and very slow.",Male
"I love Dr. Z! He has been my physician for over 20 years and I wouldn't want it any other way. He knows his craft and does a great job implementing his knowledge to his patients. He's very personal and easy to get along with. I have developed a great rapport with him and communication is very crucial in a doctor, patient relationship. He gets two thumbs up and I would recommend him to anyone! ??",Male
Been with him since he got out of Med-School..best Dr in the area..,Male
Dr Zabukovic and all the office staff are great. Always friendly and helpful. Never a long wait in the office. Dr. Z was recommended to me when I ended up in the ER and was looking for a new Dr. Very knowledgeable and caring. Listens to my problems and concerns.,Male
Dr Z and his staff are great ! ,Male
"Dr Zabukovic is a Saint! Very helpful and you feel like he really wants to figure out whatever it is you are going through. Full of knowledge, he goes above and beyond for people, works with all ages from all walks of life, and shows genuine concern. When I first went to him I was in a very bad position in my life, I had no insurance and he helped me figure out how to get help. and put me on the right path to get well. ",Male
"Beware this 'Dr.' Six yrs ago I suddenly fell ill.  I had a masters degree, no insurance. I was sent to his office after filling out financial forms.  I don't live in South Bend, never met him, nasty office staff.  He ordered a CT scan.  Never called, or advised what was wrong or a script.  A large kidney stone in BOTH kidneys. I passed one w/ NO meds in severe pain. Other stone grew to 10 mm, damaged my kidney permanently &amp; required surgery to remove after my mom's death. Monster.",Male
"He is very thorough, answers all our questions, never makes us feel rushed, we know he cares which is huge and we trust him! Great Docotor!! ",Male
Dr. Z delivered my baby when my regular doctor was on vacation and he did such an amazing job.  I had just met him a week before my baby decided to make his big debut and he treated me as if I had been his patient for years.  He arrived at the hospital within minutes to deliver my baby and just made the entire experience so amazing overall.  He truly cares for his patients and he is now my 8 month old son's pediatrician.  I could not ask for a better doctor!!,Male

His years of experience make him outstanding.  My husband and I go for yearly checkups  and consider ourselves lucky to have such a competent physician.  He really cares about his patients!,Male
Dr. Zacca is wonderful. I have been informed that he was Dr. Michael DeBakey's Cardiologist.  What more does one need to know. ,Male
"When another Cardiologist wanted me to have a pacemaker put in for my arrhythmia , Dr. Zacca instead recommended ""cardioversion"" (stopping and restarting the heart). This was obviously a better treatment for me, especially as I was small and thin at the time. This was over 15 years ago and I'm still here. I see him annually now, but he always remembers me, as does his staff, who are VERY helpful and considerate. Dr. Zacca has a very compassionate disposition, but also fun, quirky sense of humor.",Male
Very likely.  He is personable professional. and knowledgeable.,Male

He is an excellent listener, answers all our questions, is thorough, professional and you come away feeling great to have him as your medical advocate. Staff are all great and Kerrie in particular is just awesome. Very highly recommended.",Male
Dr. Zaccari is the best. I have switched primary doctors 3 or 4 times in the last couple years because I just couldn't seem to find a doctor I felt comfortable with. Dr. Zaccari not only made me feel extremely comfortable talking with him but his caring and concern for me made me feel better when I was very sick and hurt. He is thorough in his exams and is extremely patient oriented. I would recommend Dr. Zaccari to anyone. Excellent doctor!,Male
Amazing doctor. I feel very comfortable speaking with him and he is the only doctor in many years that is willling to help me without judgement. Hands down best doctor in the area.,Male
"Dr. Zaccari is hands down, the BEST doctor that I have ever met with. For the first time in 10 years, I feel like I finally have someone on my side who genuinely cares about figuring out what is wrong with me and how to treat me.
I can't even describe how blessed I feel to have found such an amazing doctor! He's intelligent, caring, gentle and has the most comforting energy. I couldn't recommend him enough!
The office and staff were just as wonderful and everything was ran so smoothly!",Male
"Dr Zacharia is a caring, educated and magician when it comes to cosmetic surgery!  He takes his time with you, listens to your expectations and works with you to get the best, most natural look for your body.  I would recommend him (and have, many times!) to anyone!

I would recommend Dr. Z,Male

"Understanding, patient and thorough. Plus a great personality.",Male
"I love Dr. Zaccaria!! He spends the time needed with you, doesn’t rush you, and take some time to get to know you. I have recommended him to three others already and they have been just as happy! And after not needing to go for 9.5 months, his office staff remembered me like I never left.",Male
"Wonderful,talented doctor.

Good diagnostician. Everyone I recommend to Dr Z ,loves him.''
Kind, understanding, very qualified podiatrist
",Male
"Dr. Zacchei is very thorough. He has a well organized trained staff. The office is well organized as one flows to various stations for different categories of testing.
Diagnosis is clear and specific with alternative options outlined.",Male
"I was scheduled w/Dr. Zacchei about 1 hr before I actually saw him. Prior to seeing him I repeated myself to 3 different assistants who obviously didn't communicate with each other. When he finally came in, he was unapologetic regarding the wait and seemed very short and uncaring. When I expressed frustration he continued to repeat himself and his limited suggestions (which I had to pull out of him after sharing my frustration). I will not return to him.",Male
Very arrogant and disrespectful to patients.  Am not sure of the medical advice he provided.  Rushed and just wanted to schedule procedure and move things along too quickly.  Would not recommend.  ,Male
"RUSHED through both preop and postop appointments. Did not discuss or offer different lense options. Three weeks after surgery, I will require a significant prescription for distance vision and need to return for a YAG procedure to correct continued cloudiness. Day of surgery I felt like I was on an assembly line conveyor belt. Their rushed, high volume practice, while profitable, in my experience compromised my care and surgical outcome.  ",Male
"Dr. Zacchei is great! He has been treating my glaucoma for many years and he has truly saved my vision. He also removed my cataracts and restored my eyesight to almost normal, which is amazing considering I'd been wearing pretty strong glasses for distance for the last 46 years! I very highly recommend Dr. Zacchei!",Male
"Dr. Zacchilli's superb surgical experience, professionalism, and excellent reputation made me feel safe and ready for my ACL reconstruction and medial meniscus repair. I am on my 5th month of rehabilitation- running, jumping, rediscovering activities I thought I'd lost forever. Dr. Zacchilli brought me back to active life! His professional attitude spoke volumes and we established a trustful relationship. Dr. Zacchilli was very meticulous in examining and diagnosing me. During every visit he gave me 100% of his attention, thorough information and evaluation of my medical state, answered all my questions, listened carefully, and made me feel understood. He and his office were in constant communication since the moment I became their patient. 

Now I am complete again and reaching back to 100%. Thank you !",Male
Front desk needs to perk up a little. But he and his MA and PA are very knowledgeable. Very caring. He is not like other surgeons I've been to in which they mention surgery if it's not needed or may make things worse. He is very helpful and knows his stuff.,Male
"I had the most amazing experience with Dr. Zacchilli. He was not only professional, but his bedside manner was like nothing I have ever experienced. His attitude towards educating me with regards to my needs were like no other Dr I have seen. His medical knowledge was unparrelled. I would recommend Dr Zacchilli without reservation. ",Male
"Was treated for conditions for which the Dr. does not have the expertise to treat (infectious disease Dr.). With many ambiguous symptoms that mimicked a lot of different diseases - could have been anything. Treatments were very expensive, not covered by insurance, and there was not medical coding for the procedures for which I was being treated. All the labs and insurance were being handled by the office manager, and then when insurance didn't pay, i was asked to pay more. Bewar",Male
"I would highly recommend Dr. Zacco and his staff for hair transplantation. Dr. Zacco does an excellent job of explaining the various hair graft procedures and the realistic results that can be achieved. I found Dr. Zacco to be personable, honest and up front. I have had two procedures with Dr Zacco and staff and the pain with both was minimal. His staff and clinic are superb in all respects.",Male
Dr. Zacco did a great job with my hair. My pre-treatment counseling was accurate and informative. I had all the information I needed to make a good decision about my hair. The results were fantastic. If you want more hair this is the best solution for permanent hair. Dr. Zacco and his team did a terrific job making me feel at home during the procedure and with all the care after the treatment. I can recommend him unconditionally.,Male
"Avoid At All Costs!

I had a FUE hair transplant done by Dr. Zacco and company. I should have listened to all the bad reviews online, but I met with them and for some reason felt comfortable.

They told me that nobody would even know I had the procedure after 4 weeks. It has been 2 full months and have serious complications. I have divots in my forehead that he never brought up until I brought them to his attention after 3 office visits. 

I spoke with several experts (he is not one of them) and",Male
"Contradicted himself many times making treatment choices confusing.

High fees.  Charged extra for everything, including answering questions or consulting with other physicians. ",Male
"Do not go here if you value patient confidentiality.  The staff has ignored repeated request to secure their garbage.  The result is papers and medical debris flying all over Camac street.  I have found several documents with patient information on it and, despite bringing this to Dr. Zaccone's attention, the staff continues to leave their garbage unsecured.  Ultimately, this leads to garbage blowing out of the bags and all over the street.",Male
"Avoid at all costs.  Just a ""certifier"" for druggies and low-lifes.  If you want legitimate Psychiatric care; look elsewhere.  This office is as CROOKED as they COME!",Male
"Dr. Zach was dismissive of my symptoms and after several months with no success, I stopped seeing her. She told me she was confident imaging wouldn’t show anything. Eventually I found another doctor who listened to me, but because Dr. Zach made me feel stupid, it delayed my treatment for over a year and a half. New doctor finally ordered imaging and there was something wrong after all which will require surgery. Very disappointed with the care I received from her. Wouldn’t recommend.",Female
"This is outdated. I see Dr Zach at the Medical College of Wisconsin.  She is outstanding.  She has helped to nurse several joints along until they were replaced.  She finds the right balance of pain control and motion.  Because she is not a surgeon, she looks for non-surgical solutions.  She is open to all ideas. She looks at the patient from a holisatic point of view. ",Female
Dr Zach is very knowledgeable and makes every effort to explain the different options that are available for you as the patient.  I have never had a doctor take as much time with me explaining what she was going to do and what my other options would be if I needed additional treatment.  She is a true professional and is never on too much of a hurry to sit and discuss things with her patients.  Love her staff!,Female
"Doesn’t listen, poor diagnostician, doesn’t give you a treatment plan just a quick opinion.   If you don’t have a concrete issue for her to fix, she won’t be able to fix it. Had a torn ankle tendon with a delay of actual treatment of 1 &amp; 1/2 years to which she said orthotics would fix me and I didn’t need to come back.  I found other doctors that could address it.",Female
Dr Zach is  very kind and is an expert at his field. He is also very patient and understanding with those like me who have been apprehensive of procedures. I do not feel like he is in a hurry at my appts. He gives the time needed to his patients to make sure they understand a given procedure and to answer any questions. His staff is kind and I am always greeted with a kind word and smile!,Male
Dr Zach is very thorough and deeply cares for his patients!,Male
I found Kelly Zach to be understanding and a good listener. His demeanor is calm and thoughtful. My case isn't typical and he's gone beyond my expectations.,Male
The staff is excellent here. My appointment was on time and everyone was helpful. A plan was developed to improve my health.,Male
I had a great experience! The wait to be seen was quick.  The PA came in to the examination room and did an evaluation followed by Dr. Zach.  Dr. Zach recommended treatment and was back within minutes to administer it.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend to others to visit Innovative Pain &amp; Spine Specialists.,Male
Dr. Zach gave me excellent care.  Minimal pain and optimal relief. The nurses and support staff were very efficient and reassuring. I was given great follow up instructions and they called the next day after my appointments to check on me.,Male
